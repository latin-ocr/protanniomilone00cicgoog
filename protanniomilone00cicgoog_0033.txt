xxii PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

amount of his debts‡; the intention being to exclude any one whose
insolvent condition made it likely that he would endeavour to enrich
himself at the public expense. This must have been amere form, and
Milo treated it as such, returning his debts at 6,ooo,ooo sesterces ¹.
Clodius thereupon publicly questioned Milo upon the subject in the
senate, and was replied to by Cicero, who inveighed against the past
career of Clodius in terms similar to those used in the pro Milone, and
particularly denounced the proposal of Clodius to give equal voting
rights to the freedmen.

The year closed without any elections having taken place. There
were no magistrates at Rome, except the tribunes, and these, with the
connivance of Pompey, who saw the fruit now within his grasp, would
not allow an interrex to be chosen, with a view to the ultimate holding
of the comziziz. At last came the inevitable end. The rivals met upon
the Appian Way, and the fate which had so long been hanging over
Clodius descended upon him. The story of the murder is told by
Asconius with scrupulous faimess. He probed the facts to the bottom,
and has given us an account which is a model of patient research.

That the encounter was an accidental one is the conclusion of
Asconius, and there is no reason to doubt the truth of this. If the
murder had taken place during the fray, it is possible that a lenient view
would have been taken of the occurrence, as in more modern timeS,
when a duellist killed his antagonist in fair fight. The Romans however,
with their sentimental regard for the life of a Roman, even if he were
acriminal, heard with horror how the defenceless and bleeding wretch‘
had been dragged out of his hiding-place, robbed οξ his ring, and
butchered on the high-road, while the keeper of the tavern at Bovillae,
who had given him shelter, shared his fate. There were ugly tales in
circulation as to what happened after the murder. A credible witness
aperson of some position ², in whose villa near Ulubrae, not far from
the scene of the tragedy‚ Cicero had once stayed as a guest ³, afterwards
gave evidence that he and four other men, all citizens, had been passing
by at the time of the murder, and that when they called out, and inter-
fered, they were seized by Milo, and imprisoned in his villa. Another*
story was, that after the slaughter Milo searched the villa of Clodius
in order to find and murder his infant son, and failing to discover him,
killed the bailiff and two other slaves, while one faithful servant was
tortured to death, Milo's men cutting him ‘limb from limb⁴.’ ln his
