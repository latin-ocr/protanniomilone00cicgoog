I.e. the means at the disposal of the combatants ¹. Milo was handicapped
by the size and character of his followers‚ and by the presence of Fausta.
Clodius was prepared for fighting. He owed his death to the courage of
his intended victim‚ and the loyalty of the latter's slaves.
The mention of the slaves leads to the introduction of a

This forms the first part of the approbata. Arguments for and ss-qfr
against quaestiones are given in the text-bookst Cicero here, however,
has to argue the case from a different point of view, since he is not
discussing the value of evidence already given, bnt has to justify the
Ι conduct of Milo in manumitting his slaves, and thus freeing them from
, examination. He does this by an audacious misrepresentation. Slave·
evidence,'he says, is only useful ripon a question of fact, and is inapplicable ¹
in a matter of right and wrong, such as the present. He thus reverts to
the original status of the case, aiere an tartaria, suppressing the antecedent
question uter utrr' r'nrrir’zas ficerat, which he has actually been arguing ³.
' The law does not allow slaves to be examined against their masters, since

Forming the second part of the approbatio ⁴. This is especially directed
against the suspicions of Pompey. It was said that Milo was storing
arms, and preparing for a caup de marn. Also‚ that drunken slaves of his
made confidences to a butcher about an attack on Pompey‚ and then

’ wounded their confidant. Milo was charged with wearing aweapon in

the senate, and promptly cleared himself. The other charges were equally
groundless.

² Herenn, ii. ιο, de Inv. ii. 46 and 50, Quintil. v. 4 The chief argument to be
urged in favour of torture is neos nraa'orum, and against it, the unreliability of evidence
thus obtained. The subject must have been worn threadbare in the courts, and itis
difficult to see how such hackneyed arguments could intinence a juror.
