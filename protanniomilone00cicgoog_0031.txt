was thrown definitely against Milo, whose election would have been
a serious impediment to the execution of his carefully-thought-out plan.

To Caesar, then preparing ior his mighty struggle with Vercingetorix,
the candidature oi Milo must have been still less agreeable. Milo was
not himself a man to initiate a policy, but he was an invaluable instru-
ment in carrying out the ideas of others. With Cat0, Bibulus, and
Domitius Ahenobarbus at bis back to inspire him, the ‘fighting consul'
would at once have proceeded to attack the ‘citadel¹' of Caesar, by
impugning the legality of bis acts during his consulship.

From the point of view of public interest the electiori of Milo would
have been a deplorable one. He had given no indication of any higher ·
qualities than those suitable to a captain ol bandr'ttr'. His savage instincta,
foolhardy courage, and narrow vision made him incapable of realizing
the responsibilities of office. His talent for running into debt struck
his friends as amazing2. If he had been sent to a province his
rapacity must have known no bounds. Verres was content to make
‘three fortunest’ in Sicily, but Milo had squandered three inheritances
already ⁴, and the exactions of such a spendthrift must have been ⁸
colossal· if he wished to replenish his empty coffers.

Cicero was Milo's most enthusiastic backer. He never forgot that

ο although Pompey sanctioned his recall, and the optimates made it a party·

’ question, still it was to Milo that he owed everything. One of the most
charming traits in his character is the warmth oi his gratitude to those
who worked in his behalf‚ not only to Milo, but also to the cross-grained
and chilling⁶ Sestius. niso, in the matter os his friends, he was an
incurable optimist. He did not see that there was no room for such
a person as Milo in a civilized community. The year before he incurred
the ridicule of Caesar by endeavouring to bring about areconciliation
between him and Milo θ, while he was seriously disappointed, when he
found that Pompey definitely set his face against his former associate.
He endeavoured to secure for Milo young Curio, then coming back srom
Asia, whose peculiar genius sor intrigue would have made him an
admirable electioneering agent. He says, ‘We want a leader‚ an
adviser, some one to rule and gulde the influences of which I spoke,
and, if we had to choose one person out of all mankind, I know of
no one comparable to yourself⁷.' Curio, however, the ‘creature of
impulse⁸' as his friends considered him, was too wary to accept the
