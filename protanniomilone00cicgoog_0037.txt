xxvi PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

guished men in Rome. Among them was the moralist, Cato, who on
entering the box ceased to be a partisan 3 a formidable juror, whom the
culprit hesitated to challenge lest it should be thought he had a bad con-
science ¹, and who incorruptibly condemned friend and foe alike.

Public opinion was becoming increasingly hostile to Milo. The mist ‘
of passion began to lift, and men saw with horror the precipice yawning
before them. A fit of morality passed over Rome, and to appease the
conscience of the community,a victim had to be found. Milo was a man
of no illusions, and saw that he was lost. He refused to go into mourning,
and appeared with that old defiant 100k2, which rnen knew so well. That
he had no aversion to the ordinary methods of exciting compassion is
clearly shown by his behaviour two years before, when he had been one
of the kneeling suppliants who entreated mercy for Scaurus ³. Two
friends at least were staunch to him, Caelius and Cicer0. That Caelius
should have been faithful is no matter for surprise. His attachments
were warm, and the opportunity of fiouting, not only public opinion, but
the great Pompey‚ would be irresistible to him. Cicero's devotion is more
creditable to him, since the tribunes, Q. Pompeius Rufus, and Plancus,
‘the ape' of Clodius, threatened to impeach him before the people; .
a menace which must have seriously alarmed his nervous disposition.
Still he resolved to be a grateful man, and refused to desert that com· .
promising friend who had brought him back from exile.

Milo meanwhile had been accused on four counts, two of course being
under Pompey's lawe. For the murder he was prosecuted by two
nephews of the dead man, whose right to bring the charge no one
disputed. They also laid a charge of bribery against him, but here they

·had first to compete with rival accusem. The right to prosecute was
finally awarded to them. He was also accused of having entered into
illegal associations (de sodaliciis), and of riot, apparently under the
provisions of the old lex Cornelia ⁴. The prosecutors under the two latter
charges were mercenary persons who hoped for a judgment by default, in
which case they would claim the reward given to a successful accuser.

The Presidents in the two courts, which were to hear the first or the
serious charges, both fixed on April 4 for the opening of the case. The
collision was merely a formal one, since when the day came, Torquatus,
the President de ambr'iu, postponed the case until the trial for murder was
over. The trial took four days, three of which were occupied by the
examination of witnesses. On the first day there was an incipient riot‚
