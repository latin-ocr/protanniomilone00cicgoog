variant found in H, § 79. On the other hand, in § ro he supports debent,
and in ξ 105 possum, so TE, against uolunt and possumus H. It may

be a mere coincidence that in ξ 8, quoted v. rr. 8, cod. A, the best MS,
has dzbr’nae, the corruption also found in TE [dz'vr'rra edd.].
The earliest and the most valuable'evidence respecting the text is to

be found in the lemmata of Asconius. His quotations are uniformly
in favour of H. The chief case, the importance of which cannot be

overestimated is the omission in ξ 46 of the scholium curies . . . Romae,
for which l refer‘to my note. Other notable agreements are § 37 z'ntenta,

and §47 diceret. Minor cases will be found in the notes to §§ 14, 37, 49,
67 bis. Though sometimes he differs from all our MSS. he never agrees
with TE against H.

The results hitherto arrived at may be summed up as follows :—

(i) That the later dett. are useless, and among them is to be
included s, which should disappear from the list of first-class authorities.

(ii) That the three MSS. H T E, together with the lost W, and
the fragments of P, are the only source of real knowledge.

(iii) That W was agemellus of T, and therefore does not add to its
authority. ·
(iv) That T is the sons deteriorum.

(v) That E is a ‘mixed’ MS, agreeing in base with T, but cor· ι
rected from H.

(vi) That in all probability H and T do not come from the same
source.

(vii) That P is by no means infallible, and is too scanty to be
acceptedlas an arbiter.

(viii) That many of the variants in the text go back to a remote
antiquity.

l have hitherto refrained from discussing the merits of H as compared
with TE, partly because I do not wish to repeat matter to be found
in the notes to the speech, and partly since, if the theory advanced as
to the formation ola-E is accepted, the superiority of H follows of
necessity, since no one would now advocate the claims of T. l think
it proper, however, to add a few words here upon the source from which
the MS. has been taken, and upon the character of its recension.

*The contents of the MS. are of various value, being drawn from

' · a number of different sources. In some cases the scribe had before him

an ancient MS, in others a comparatively modern one. This is shown
by the presence or absence of faulty divisions‚ and by the style of writing,
which in some parts is more archaic than in others. Ifwe apply this
test it would appear that in the later part of the MS, sc. ff. 137 bto 180, the
