lii PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

Pompey has done nothing except order an enquiry. He did this, not
because the death of Clodius differed from that of other men, but in
order to show his own impartiality. He has shown the verdict he desires

by putting in the box the strongest men in Rome, and Domitius himself
on the bench [ξς 15-22].

After thus clearing the ground he proceeds to state the facts :-

(iii) 7tallldfio: §§ 24-29. ιω*

In this three things are necessary: ‘ut brenti, ut dz'lucr'da, ut veri
szinz'ltt sit ¹.' Further it should be told in such away as to suggest the
points afterwards taken up in the tractatio ².

The narratio here is: (a) brenti, since Cicero plunges into the subject,
and uses all possible compression; (b) dz'lucz'da‚ since he observes the
proper sequence of events ; (c) veri srinz'ltlr, as a model of artful simplicity³.
The language employed is that of good conversation, never attempting to
soar, but neither vulgar, nor bald ⁴.

The rule that it should suggest the points afterwards argued is strictly
observed: thus ἐξ 24-26, describing the projects and character of Clodius,
correspond to ἕξ 32-43, containing the probabile ex causa and ex uz'la,
while ἐξ 27-29, with their artful references to the place, the time, and
the occasion of the murder, anticipato the argument from the signa in

ε The narratio leads to the const utzffihaufae, §§ 30, 31. Was Milo
ε right or wrong in killing Clodius? This depends upon the antecedent
efce'gquestiom uter utri taradros fecerit. The accuser says it was Milo, and
’ pf» the defender‚ Clodius. The conllict of these two statements gives us fise

ἵ ἵ lt was usual to state the point at issue earlier in a speech; but Cicero
pfgpostponed it to the narrato, since the defence depends upon the colour
:oc‘pgiven to the facts. Theline to be followed was only indicated in ξς 6 „l
φ’ and 23, but now is definitely adopted. As aquestion of fact is at issue, i
the character of the arguments is changed. To use technical language‚
although the status of the case is tenuicula, sc. titre an ahalaria occiderit

Milo Clodiam, the constristat causatis coniecturalis. The rules laid down
