AUTHORITIES FOR EVENTS OF 52 B.C. xiii

mentioned by Appian in addition to those of Milo and his rivals,
. e. g. Hypsaeus, are those of Scaurus, Memmius, and Sestius. We know
from Cicero1 that the last was tried under the lex Pompeio, and one
would naturally expect to find him in trouble together with Milo ². The
case of Scaurus is one of special interest. He was originally accused of
extortion by Triarius in 54. The charge was laid on July 6, and he was
acquitted on Sept. 4, after having been defended by Cicero. Triarius then
renewed the attach, and accused him of bribery‚ shortly before Oct. ro in
the same year. We have no record of the verdict‚ but we know that he
was not elected consul in 53, for which office he had been standing.
Drumann, who rejects the story in Appian, supposes that he was con·
demned. Zumpt, who accepts it, thinks he was then acquitted‚ and tried
again under the lex Pompam. In support of the first theory I would
point out that in 53 the house of Scaurus was in the market‚ and was
bought by Clodius ³. In connexion with this sale there is a significant
passage, De Officiis, i. 138. The builder of the house, Cn. Octavius, was
the first of his family to become consul, and the view of his great mansion
was thought to have given him dignity in the eyes of the voter. Scaurus
pulled down this house, and added a fresh wing to his own upon the site.
‘Octavius' says Cicero, ‘was the first to bring the consulship to his'
house. Scaurus. . . in domum multiplicatam non repulsam solum
attulit, sed ignominiam etiam et columnatam? As the house was sold
in 53, the calamitas, or condemnation and loss of status, would naturally
be prior to this, in which ease the conclusion is hostile to Zurnpt's
theory, and to 'Appian's pretensions to veracity.

In the remaining case, that of Memmius we have fewer facts to go
upon. He was a candidate, together with Scaurus, and was accused of
ambitus at the same time ⁴. In 51 he was in exile at Mytilene. The
probability is that he was condemned at the same time as Scaurus We
hear nothing more of him as a candidate for the consulship in 53.
Appian goes on to narrate, that, after his condemnation, he endeavoured to
rehabilitate himself by accusing Metellus Scipio. It is significant that the
more careful Dio, when speaking of the charge brought against Scipi0,
says he was accused ὑπὸ δυοῖν ⁶, and does not mention Memmius.

¹ Ate xiii. 49. 1.

² Itis at least as likely that Appian is thinking of the previous trial, when the
pro Sestio was delivered, and assigned this to the wrong year.

³Asson. 33 erat domus Clodi ante paucos menses empta de M. Scauro in
Palatio.

(Ω. F. iii. 2. 3.

³ 1 take this to mean two rival accusers. Zumpt harmonizes the statements by
supposing that Memmius found a subscriptor.
