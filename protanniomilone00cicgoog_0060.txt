is not comforting, since the next inference is, that in all cases where we

· have not such good MSS.,—as e. g. Pand L are fn the de Senectute-

criticism builds upon an insecure foundation ; that e. g. in the pro Milone,
whereP is deficient, a conjecture may be put forward, which suits the
sense, but is not convincing, since the readings before us are themselves
the deposit of an ancient, and intelligentiy-formed recension. Still, com-
forting or not, the question is, whether the conjecture is right, or, as in
such cases it is not easy to determine the truth, whether it is probable.'

That smustbe excluded from the list of authoritiesl have shown above,
while I hold the extreme value attributed to P by recent critics to be
imaginary. The general and necessary untrustworthiness of our MSS,
however, could not be more cogently expressed. ‘Comforting' the con·
clusion may not be, but it is by the shaking of ‘ comfortable’ beliefs that
the spirit of inquiry is quickened.

The Milmnhna belongs to the third or most finished period in the
development of Cicero's style. As is well known, at the beginning of his
career he had shown an inclination towards the Asiatic school of orators;
a tendency usually ascribed to the influence exercised upon him by
Hortensius ¹. 'The characteristics of these writers were a perpetual
struggling after effect, and an excessive fondness for decoration, mani-
festing themselves in elaborate periods, in rhythms repeated until they
became wearisome, in ceaseless assonances and alliterations, in collocatione
of words so artificial that the art became apparent ². The chief examples
of this first manner of Cicero are the pro Quinctio and pro Sex. Roscio
Amerino. He was cured of this tendency by his sojourn in Rhodes,
where he studied under Molon, who ‘penned within its banks'³ the
overflowing stream of his youthful eloquence. It is customary to assign
the name of Rhodian to his second style, thatin which most of his
speeches are written, this being a compromise between the luxuriance of
the Asiatics and the simplicity of the strictest Attic writers. This eclectic
style, however, was in character more nearly related to the Asiatic than to
the Attio-⁴. At this time the younger writers in Rome were thorough·
going Atticists, and selected Lysias especially as their model ⁶. The
style of Cicero himself was steadily developing in the direction of greater
simplicity, and he now disputes with his opponents the right to call
