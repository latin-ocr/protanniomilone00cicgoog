HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xxi

invitation. He vas an old friend of Clodius, and had just been quaestor
to his uncle, C. Claudius. Probably also Fulvia, the wife of Clodius,
whom he afterwards married, had him already under her control. We
have no record of the part taken by Caelius, but we may be sure that
he was hlilo's right-hand man during his canvass, as he was his fearless
defender in 52. His love of excitement, his sporting interest in elections,
his determination not to surrender acomrade, attached him closely to
Milo, while his hatred for the whole Claudian house, the legacy of his
amour with Clodia, would add bitterness to his acrimonious tangue ¹.
The Right wing of the optumates, headed by Catu, adopted Milo as their
candidate. He may have possessed military abilities ; his courage at any
rate was undeniable. With Milo in a province, and at the head of an
army, they would at last have a general of their own, to serve as a check
to Caesar, and save them from their dangerous friend, Pompey. Milo's
great strength however lay in himself. He had gained a large section
of the rabble by his extravagance and the splendour of his games.
Above all, he had his gladiatore, and with their aid might clear the
Campus of his opponents, and secure his election hya packed assembly.

To prevent this it was necessary to break up the assembly, whenever
it was called together. This was done by the hostile tribunes, who
' on every occasion announced unfavourable omens. This abuse of the
obnuntiatio had been practised by Milo himself in 57. We have an
amusing description of such tactics. ‘On Nov. 20 Milo came into the ,
Campus with a large force. Though Clodius had a picked body of
runaway slaves, he did not venture inside. Milo remained there until
mid-day. . ..Metellus Nepos however challenges Milo to use the omens
against himself in the Forum next day, saying that it was useless for him
to occupy the Campus at night. He would be in the Forum at six in .
the morning. Milo thereupon occupied the Forum on the arst, during
the night. Metellus at daybreak was hurrying stealthily by a cir-
cuitous route to the Campus. Milo overtook him by the Grove, and
announced the omens. He retired amid loud and insulting jeers from
Q. Flaccus ²3 Milo had against him three tribunes—Q. Pompeius
Rufus, his wife's nephew; Sallust, her lover, still smarting from his bruises;
and Plancus Bursa, once a client and now a bitter foe of Cicero ⁸. His
former methods were therefore used against himself.

One attempt made to foil his candidature is especially interesting.
A candidate, when giving in his name, was expected to declare the
