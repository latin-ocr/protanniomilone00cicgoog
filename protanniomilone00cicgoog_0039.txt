xxviii PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

sight for Cicero must have been the smile of Milo, as he surveyed his
defender's confusion. Milo went shortly afterwards to Massilia, where,
like atrue Roman, he consoled himself with the pleasures of the table ¹,
grimly remarking, when afterwards he received the written speech, that, if
the spoken one had been as good, he would have missed the excellent
mullets he was then eating ².

On the next day Milo was condemned in his absence for bribery, and
then the pack of minor accusers gained their morsels under the lex de
sodaliciis and the lex Plotzlz. After the condemnation of the chieftain,
his captain Saufeius was arraigned, and gained a sensational acquittal by
one vote. This may have been due to the fierce rhetoric of Caelius, who
was this time associated with Cicero in the defence. As Saufeius had
the blood of Clodius upon his hand, this result could not pass unchallenged‚
and he was brought to trial again under the provisions of the Plotian law;
the result, however, on this occasion, being an acquittal by a large majority.
The jurors had salved their consciences hythe condemnation of Milo, and
now wished to show Pompey that they were not his slaves. The tables
were turned, and the incendiarios of the senate-house had to suffer.
Sextus Clodius, who had led the crowd, had only five votes given for him.
At this point the account of Asconius ceases, so that our knowledge
of the details becomes meagre and untrustworthy. That a large number
of dangerous characters were got rid of we know. Cicero and Hortensius
showed their inexhaustible fertility by pleading day after day in cases ’
closely resembling each other, without ever losing their freshness ⁸. One
of the friends, lor whom Cicero spoke, was his oldclient Sestius, who was
acquitted ⁴. A notable conviction was that of Hypsaeus, Pompey’s
nominee for the consulship, shortly afterwards followed by that of
Pompeius Rufus and Plancus Bursa, the two tribunesl. Hypsaeus
was surrendered by Pompey, who is said to have made an incredibly
brutal answer to him, when his aid was invoked ⁸. Pompeius Rufus also
was given up, but for Plancus, Pompey used all his influence, and even
broke his own law by sending to the jurors a laudatio on his behalf.
Cato protested against this infraction of the law, whereupon Plancus
ventured to challenge him, and was presently condemned for daring
to object to the incorruptible one. Cicero was overjoyed at the result
