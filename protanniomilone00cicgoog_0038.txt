HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xxvii

and the court appealed to Pompey for protection, who on the next day
marched his troops into the Forum, a novelty which made a profound
impression. The mob now began to feel the weight of Pompey’s heavy
hand. Dio¹ says that, upon a recrudescence of the disorder, he ordered
his men to strike the rioters with the flat oi their swords. The crowd
thought they were playing, and became insolent, whereupon the soldiers
used their weapons in earnest, and several rioters were wounded or killed.
The witnesses were then listened to in silence ior two days. The pro·
ceedings finally were wound up dramatically by the evidence of Fulvia
andos her mother, their hysterical grief making a deep impression upon
the hearers ². All preparatione were made sor the voting on the morrow.
The evidence was put under seal, and the tablets upon which the votes
were to be given under ballot examined, to ensure that there should be
no difference between any of them, by which it might become known
which way a juror had voted. The tension ol feeling was made more
acute by a violent speech which Plancus delivered, aiter the court dis·
solved‚ to the crowd, in which he urged them to come in their thousands
ou the morrow, and not to let the murderer escape.

The night must have been an agonising one for Cicem, who was always
a nervous speaker, and suffered from tirsomm'a on occasions when he'felt
doubtful os his ability to do justice to his powers ³. According to a not
improbable story, Milo, fearing that he might break down, had him brought
into the Forum in a closed litter, that his composure might nothe affected
by seeing the lines of soldiers⁴. These precautions were taken in vain.
When the prosecutors had spoken, and he rose to reply, conscious that
all the burden rested upon him, he was so unnerved by the sight ol the
glittering arms,'and by the yells of the mob, which even their sear oi
Pompey could not stille, that he never regained his composure, and spoke
without his usual courage. Later writers magniiy his failure, and speak
of him as hardly able to stand, stammering, and glad to sit down after
asew incoherent sentences ⁶. In view oi these exaggerated statements, one
must remember that the speech was taken down by the shorthand writers,
that it was read by Asconius, who describes the line of argument taken
up in it, 3ηά by Quintilian, who quotes from it an example of a rhetorical
figure well used⁸ ς and that it survived four centuries later in the time of
the Scholiast. Still it was an undoubted failure‚ and the most galling
