but was manifestly inapplicable to ordinary criminals. The Roman law,
however, drew no distinction between the two classes The felon or
murderer could ‘take sanctuary¹' in exile, and there begin his operations
anew. Sometimes it was not necessary for him to go far. Such
a monster as Oppianicus of Larinum, with the blood of unnumbered
victims upon his handS, is able not only to roam about Italy, but even has
alodging just outside Rome ². The treatment of vulgar crime by the
Romans is a matter of some obscurity, since our record of such cases is
scanty. That however such offences could only be proceeded against
before an ordinary quaestio is clear ⁸. A magistrate could only employ
his coercitio within narrow and recognized limits⁴3 otherwise, as in the
case of Damio, he would be checked by the intervention of a tribune.
The trzhmnir captialz's, who was at the head of the weak police, could
indeed arrest a criminal for inquiry⁶, but it is not conceivable that he
would have been able to violate the person of a citizen hythe infliction
of appropriate penalties. The conclusion is stanling, since it follows
that crime of every description, such as is found in all large centres of
civilization and must have been rampant at Rome, vae, if committed by
acitizen, protected from the sword of justice. Roman legislators had
never contemplated the task of governing a large criminal population.
The mob, however, such as now existed, pauperized by public doles,
brutalized hythe horrors of the arena, and degraded hythe continued
infiltration of slave-blood, possessing nothing but a dagger to use and
a vote to sell, was manifestly unfit for such entraordinary privileges.
Further, while the penalty awarded to crime was thus inadequate, it does
not appear to have been rigorously inflicted. A generation, which
allowed the owner to torture or put to death his slaves, as the humour
seized him, was strangely sentimental when the caput of a Roman was
concerned. In no other way can we explain the languagc of the orators,
who speak of the trivial penalty of exile as something too cruel for
merciful men to inflict upon a fellow·creature ⁶. Humanitarianism ran
within a narrow channel at Rome, but it ran deep. The inviolability of
the citizen had indeed become a mischievous anachronism, and it must
have been a benefit to the world, when under the Empire the crimina]
was made to suffer in life and limb for his crimes.

The story of Roman anarchy is inseparably connected with the name
of Clodius. lt is not here to the point to inquire what degree of credence
