THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xlv

harenam, this does not prove that the latter reading has not come to H
from an equally old, and possibly better, MS. The case must be judged
, upon its merits.

The existence of variants in the text of this speech, as in other works
of Cicero, at an early date, is shown by the evidence of Gellius and
Macrobius. Gellius distinguishes between the libri meiius accurate
scripte, and those embodying the revision of Tiro. He assigns to the
latter the reading versabatur in §53, and versabantur [so all our MSS.
except a few late dett. into which the singular has been introduced from
Gellius] to the inferior copies.

The quotations in the grammatical and rhetorical writers are very Quintilian
indecisive and contradictory. Most of them come from Quintilian, whose
carelessness in such matters is well known. Frequently he contradicts
himself. Thus in one place [xi. 3. 172] he quotes correctly Ome in-
felicem } roa, and in another [vi. 1. ²4] gives Ote infelicem. In
iv. a. 25 he gives acceium fateatur [ξ 7], but in v. 11. 12 has acceium esse
fateatur. In ix. 3. 28 he quotes accedi, accedi [§ 72], but in v.11.1a
most MSS. give oece'de’once. Sometimes he mistakes the meaning, e.g.
ξ 72 cam patream pericula sua liberasset, where he omits saa [v. 11. 121,
thus perverting the sense. So ξ 94 0 cogitatianes thanes meae, he quotes
as Ocagit. e‘n. meas, regardless of the nominative in the preceding clause.
A curious fact is, that he is followed in his slipshod quotations by later
writers, who do not seem to have troubled themselves to consult a MS.
An instructive instance occurs in his quotation of ξ 4¹· Here for
amaeam he gives aliqua, a very inferior reading, omits quem e'rapune,
words necessary to the sense, and inserts eam before pericula. His errors
are faithfully reproduced by Isidorus and Cassiodorus. 1n§ 9 he omits
aa' tamarem occulendam [v. 14. 18], and is followed by Julius Victor
and Diomedes3 in § 30 he gives si ut for sicut, so Julius Victor.

In a certain number of cases the citations of Quintilian make for
or against the readings of our MSS. Two obvious ones are§ 1, where
he omits veterem with TE, and ξ 85, where he gives testor with H
[obtestor TE] ¹. In both of these it may be assumed that he found the
reading, which he quotes, in his copy: though of course the other
reading may also have been in circulation at the time. An important
case is ix. a. 41 Cicera pra llte'lone . . . leaec quae nan vedrita acule't,
amiati· cernere potestte, a loose quotation, which supports the unique

¹ It hardly seeum fair of Dr. Nohl, immediately after quoting Quintil. against a
reading of H, possumus ἱ 105, to consider testor ἱ 85 au alteration for obtestor, in
ppppepffiqintil. He says, ‘ H. testor statt obtestor, so freilich auch Quintil.¹ [ed. 1892,
