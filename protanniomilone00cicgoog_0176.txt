IN MILONIANAM. 101

Mart. mense intercalario consul creatus est statimque consu·
latum iniit. Deinde post diem tertium de legibus novis serendis
rettulit: duas ex S. C. promulgavit, alteram de vi, qiia nominatim
5caedem in Appia via factam et incendium curiae et domum
M. Lepidi interregis oppugnatam comprehendit, alteram de
ambitu: poena graviore et forma iudiciorum breviore. Utraque
enim lex prius testes dari, deinde uno die atque eodem et ab
accusatore et a reo perorari iubebat, itaut duae horae accusatori,
10 tres reo darentur. His legibus obsistere M. Caelius tr. pl. studio·
sissimus Milonis conatus est, quod et privilegium diceret in
Milonem ferri et iudicia praecipitari. Et cum pertinacius leges
Caelius vituperaret, eo processit irae Pompeius, ut diceret, si
coactus esset, se armis rem publicam defensurum. Timebat

non domi suae, sed in hortis manebat, idque ipsum in superioribus,
circa quos etiam magna manus militurn excubabat. Senatum

se adventum Milonis. Dein proximo senatu Ρ. Cornificius serrum

The penalties ior bribery ander the old
Calpumian law had been exclusion from

atraque . . ,laxs it is generally as-
sumed that these provisions extended to
all the quaestiones, and that theywere
permanent: see Momms. iv. 325. The
former statement is made by Dio C. xl.
52, but as he is unsupported his authority
is hardly sufficient. It may well besan
inserence on his part. It seems more
likely that the new regulations were
peculiar to the two special quaestibus,

est euim privilegium. A special inquiry
into the case oi Milo could, however,
hardly be described as a breach oi this
statute. A precedent at any rate was
rumished by the rogatio brought iorward
