Α HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xv

took place in 57 sc. ‘You remember, Gentlemen of the jury, that the

Tiber was filled with the bodies of citizens, that the sewers were choked,

that blood was mopped up with sponges from the Forum! This was '

a new development, but his description of previous practice is equally
instructive. ‘We have often seen stones fly, we have seen swords used,
not so often, yet still too often, but whoever saw such a massacre, such
piled-up heaps of bodies in the Fomm, except perhaps on the day when
Cinna and Octavius fought? What was the cause of the excitament?
A riot often arises from the veto of an obstinate or uncompromising
tribune, or from a culpable and unscmpulous proposal meant to win over
the ignorant hythe promise of advantage, or again from a rivalry between
magistrates. It begins imperceptibly3 first comes an uproar, then a
swaying to and fro within the meeting. It is with reluctance, late in the
day, and seldom‚ that men resort to blows. Who ever heard before of
a riot at night when not a word has been said, no meeting called, no
law read aloud to the crowd i'

This account is without doubt exaggerated for oratorical purposeS,
but cannot be dismissed as mere rhetoric. A story told gravely by
a serious antiquarian, who gives quotations from official documents, is
more significant ¹. In this same year Pompey suspected that his life was
in danger from a slave of Clodius. He took refuge in his house, and
shut himself up there. Clodius replied by sending a satellite of his, one
Damio, who, of course at the head of a gang, laid formal siege to the
Great Conqueror of the East. Damio was disturbed by one of the
praetors for the year, upon which, holding that as a citizen he had
a constitutional right to besiege another citizen, he appealed to a tribune
for promerion, selecting one whom he 'had himself assaulted. The
decision is quoted from the Acta. The tribune says, ‘he has himself
been wounded by Damio, Pompey is being beleaguered in his house,
still as a conscientious officer he has no alternative but to rescind the
proceedings,’ thus setting Damio free to continue the siege.

This astonishing story reveals clearly the cause which chiefly con·
tributed to the growth of the evil: viz. the exaggerated respect for the free·
dom of the critis, and the consequent enfeeblement of the executive. The
early legislators had consistently laboured to produce these results The
death-penalty had become obsolete3 the sacred body of a Roman citizen
was not subject to stripes or physical indignity. Outlawry, which had
' been substituted for death, could be evaded by going into exile. This
provision might have some justification in the case of political offenders,
