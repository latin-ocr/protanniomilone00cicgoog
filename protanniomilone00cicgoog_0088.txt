non, etiam si e re publica oppressa sunt, rem publicam tamen
vulnerarunt. Itaque ego ipse decrevi, cum caedem in via Appia 6
factam esse constaret, non eum qui se defendisset, contra rem
publicam fecisse, sed, cum inesset in re vis et insidiae, crimen
sindicio reservavi, rem notavi. Quodsi per furiosum illum tr.

nullam haberemus; decernebat enim ut veteribus legibus, tantum

Madvig, since it would require a third

ille before it, cf. 5 yon. Those editors

who adopt qno either suppose an ellipse

of oppressa trent after Samen, or mark

· etiam sie rep. as a parenthesis. The
latter is the easier construction.

1. etim at a rena ‘even if it were
to the advantage of the State that they
were crushed.' E rep. marks an antithesis
to contra rem p., the phrase being used
adverbially. Dr. Reid quotes for this use
de Or. ii. 124 multas e re p. seditiones
saepe esse factas. The Schol. Bob.
explains ὼε argument thus: ‘hoc munit
exemplis plu'ribus eornm, quos ex nsu
reip. constabat occisos) For the use of
opprimere in this context cf. Ascon. ire
t'ornel. 64 ipse Sulpicius consulum armis
iure oppressus esse visus est, and in
Pisonianam 17 notum est Opimium . . .
C. Gracchum oppressisse3 Cic. Cat. iii.
²4 L. Sulla P. Sulpicium oppressit. It
will be noticed that all MSS. have reon
twice, both before etiam si and before
vulnerarunt. 1 follow Madvig in striking
ont the second nore since it would be easily
inserted after tamen [tn] by a dittography.
At one time 1 thought it probable that
the variants pointed to an original reading
etiam si res p. oppresso nonest . . . non
velannorum, in which case both negatives
would be retained. If the first non, after
being omitted sno Ioco, had been inserted
before etiam si, an alteration of est to
sunt would naturally follow, while r. p.
would be interpreted as rep, the reading
of H. From i. p. the further corruption

· ere p. would easily arise. For corrup·
tions of resp. cf. § 6512. This conjecture

remp. oppressam, Leg. Agr. ii. 19, Dom.
122, Sest. 81, Phil. xii. 15; rep. oppressa
594, Dom. 2, 26, Sest. 84, Phil. viii. 5.
An optimate orator naturally speaks more
frequently of the State as ‘crushed by
traitors' than of it as ‘crushing traitors.'
I now, however, see that the antithesis of
e re p. aud contro rem p. is intentional.
So many conjectures have been made
upon this passage that I may be pardoned
for mentioning this one.

a. vta Appia: see § 18 n.

5. tr. pb: sc. Plancus. Cicero only
speaks of one tribune, although we know
that Sallust also vetoed the proposal
(Asson. ad loc). Cf. §5 12, 47.

7. decernebat: on the proposal of
Hortensius. In this case Milo would
have come before a weak jury, and might
have been acquitted: see p. xxv. Fufius
Calenus, the nescioquis of this passage,
was well aware of this, since he had gained
the acquitral of Clodius in B.c. 61 by
similar tactics. Hortensius then ac·
quiesced, thinking that ‘a sword of lead '
would serve to cut Itis throat,’ Att. i.
16. 2. On this occasion Fufius and Hor-
tensius reversed their former parts, Fufius
urging the extraordinary, and Hortensius
the ordinary method of procedure.

retenens lacibus, cf. t ι 3.

8. extra ordinem: this was usual in
cases tried under the lex Plotia: cf.
Cael. 1, Fam. viii. 8. 1.
