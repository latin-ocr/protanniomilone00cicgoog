HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. ⁴ xxix

‘I hated Bursa much worse thau Clodius himself. l had attached Clodius,
whereas 1 defended him. Clodius had a great object in view.. . and
acted not of his own accord, but at the instigation of those whose
prosperity was incompatible with mine. This ape singled me out for
his invectives, just to amuse himself, and had convinced some of my ⁴
ill-wishers that he would always be ready to fly at me ¹.' Never were
seen such independent jurors. At last even Pompey's patience gave
way, when an accuser ventured to prosecute Metellus Scipio. According
to a late writer the sole-consul himself went into mourning ². At any rate
the prosecutor felt that he was dying at too high game and desisted.

A dictator at Rome only held office for six months. Pompey was not,
indeed, dictator in name, but, with that respect for constitutional forms
which characterised him, limited the period of his extraordinary power by
coopting on Aug. 1 a colleague, his father-in-law, Metellus Scipio. It is
obvious that by this date his work must have been completed, otherwise
he would not have surrendered the plenary power which had been entrusted
to him. His proceedings have been sharply criticised by some modern
writers. Mommsen says disparagingly of him that ‘he pushed‘the trans-
parent'fiction of faimess so far, that, instead of putting safe-instruments
into the special commission for the investigation of the late tumult, he
chose the most respectable meu of all parties, including Cato ⁸! So, again,
he says that it was ‘a specimen of Pompey's folly’ that wishing to appear
impartial, he did not prevent the condemnation of his friends. Quite
apart from the question of morah, which no doubt largely influeuced
Pompey, who was in his way a virtuous and honest man, it may be argued
that it was good policy for him to act as he did. lf he had made
Hypsaeus Rufus, and Plancus presidents of his courts, and packed the
juries with his own creatures, he would have shocked the moral sense of
the community, and have made impossible that rapproclzement between
himself and the optimates, which was now taking place. Further, in spite
of his uprightnesS, he was a¹ cold man, and it never cost him a paug to
surrender anyone who had compromised himself too deeply in his service.

It was by the sacrifice of such men as Hypsaeus and Rufus that he was
able to convince the world of his sincerity, and to figure as the consti·
tutional regenerator of his country.

After the trials were over, the eloquence which had been ‘ gagged' in

the Forum, broke forth in the form of. pamphlets. M. Brutus wrote ’·
a speech as a rhetorical exercise, ‘practising with the foils,' as Quintilian
