, PRO T. ANNIO MILONE. 25

Statim complures cum telis in hunc iaciunt de loco superiore
impetum, adversi raedarium occidunt. Cum autem hic de raeda
reiecta paenula desiluisset seque acri animo defenderet, illi,

tut a tergo Milonem adorirentur, partim, quod hunc iam inter·
sectum putarent, caedere incipiunt eius servos, qui post erant3
ex quibus qui animo fideli in dominum et praesenti luerunt,
partim occisi sunt, partim, cum ad raedam pugnari viderent,
domino succurrere prohiberentur, Milonem occisum et ex ipso
10 Clodio audirent et re vera putarent, fecerunt id servi Milonis ⁵
