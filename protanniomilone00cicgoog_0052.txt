THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xli

In some of these T probably misrepresents the archetype: in others,

the copy from which Ewas taken was doubtless corrected by marginal
additions taken from a MS. 9179119779 H.

(ii) In the collocation of words. In twenty-eight cases it agrees with H,
⁸0· ii 6, 7, 8, 11, 16, 99, 42 bis, 49, 54 bis, 59, 64, 68, 69, 74, 78, 79, 89,
87, 99, 94, 95, 96, 99, 100, 101 bis. These instances 7997179 show that
among the vices of T is a tendency to alter the order. In some cases it
looks as if an omitted word had been added in the margin of the archetype,
and inserted in the wrong place by T, eg. 9 6. vitam ab inimicorum
audacia telisque HE: abzhzinicorum audacia telisque vitam T. 989. Quae
mulier interficere sceleratum ac perniciosum civem HE, quae mut. scel. ac
pernimia zitterficere T. The superior correctness of E in the collocation
of words is of some importance in 99 78-37, where H is defective.

(iii) In readings characteristic of H as opposed to T. These are, 9 9.
collocata. 93. verum, ib. prae. 96. 919. 979. verum. 979. aut summurn.

949. tenebras. 948. add. Cyri. 959. om. de servo. 965. probari.
9 69. videa, ib. amicitiis, ib. metu, ib. salutaribus. 9 76. immitteret.
9 80. immortalitatis. § 96. haec arma. These were doubtless added hy
a corrector to the archetype 91 Ε 17997 H or a similar MS. It will be
noticed that they are somewhat local in their distribution, occurring

chiefly in a few sections.

(iv) The original contributions of E 979 neither numerous nor im-
portant. They consist of—

(α) Changes in the order of words [99 6, 46, 52, 55, 65, 67, 79].

(6) Blunders, e. g. 9 5. exercitatum. 9 73. 9999799; sen. consultum.
9 37. haec, baec. 9 63. cederet: secederet. 9 64. popae: pompaeum.
9 68. praeturae: praecii ne. 9 76. civitatis: civilitatis. 9 88. 111979 : per
illum. 9 91. et sunt: sedeunt. § 104. quem: quem nos.

(c) Plausible variants: the chief are, 9 74. inessent. 9 39. 19917.
9 53. pugnandum. 9 69. abrepti. 9 76. om. iam. 9 85. Latiaris, 9 91. om.
et before auctor. 9 89. 9979 99991997.

(d) 619999999919797991971999,9.3.9 7. ab improbis: saepe ab improbis.
§ 7 5. at paret: at apparet. 9 39. illius: 7117179 Clodi. 9 48. antevertit:
antevenit § 59 proxime deos: proxime in deos. 9 799. dimicatio capitis:
diiniimtzh capitii, an instructive instance as showing that the corrector
possessed some knowledge. 9 101. exsilium: sed exsilium.

’ E then is a contaminated MS, taken 17979 7179 archetype 91 7179 Τ group,
and corrected from the H family. Its chief importance is that it throws
light upon the archetype of T, the two MSS. serving to check each other.
It cannot, however, be said that HE are more valuable than H sol, or

TE than T.
