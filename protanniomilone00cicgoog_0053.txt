The result of this analysis is strictly in accordance with the general
character of E, and will surprise no scholar who has studied its readings
in works for which we have superior MSS. evidence, e. g. in the
Cato Maior, or haelius, where the contaminated character of its recen·
sion is notorious ¹. The position ascribed to it above is analogous to

· that which it occupies, e. g. in the pro Rege Deiotaro, where it repre·

sents a eross between the Ambrosianus and the Gudianus or between
the two recensions in H ².

Furtber, that E is in some places directly dependent upon H, the older
M S, has already been proved. Thus the Verrine excerpts found in both
MSS. were copied into E, or an ancestor of E, from H. This is in-
disputable as a large omission in E occupies exactly one line in H³.
Also, in these all the alterations of the second handare followedby E.
Again, both MSS. give a curious mediaeval Introduction to the pro
Milone. This in H is out of place, being put before the Verrine excerpts,
which follow without any mark of separation. In E it is given in the
margin at the beginning of the pro Milone, and the alterations of the
second hand in H reproduced. Other points of contact are in the fourth
speech against Catiline, where the superscriptions inE are taken from H,
and in the speeches before Caesar, where, they corne from the duplicate,
or inferior recension contained in H ⁴. ln view of these ascertained facts,
the theory that the ancestor of E has in this speech been corrected from
H cannot be called improbable.

We are thus left with the two eleventh-century MSS. H and T, the
latter representing the deterior and the former the melzbr samr'lz‘a. ls it
possible to further simplify the problem by referring them to a common
source? If this can be done the critic will be able to work more boldly
in the revision of the text than ifthey are independent‚ since in the latter
case the likelihood of a corruption having occupied both recensions has
always to be considered. The difference between the two MSS. is certainly
'very great, as Me figures already given show. Also H hasa large lacuna
from§§18-37peculiar to itself⁶. The fact that the same corruptions
are often found in both MSS. does not prove much, since it cannot be
doubted that the process of correcting and with it of corrupting MSS.

⁶ It was doubtless owing to the existence of this lacuna iu H that T was preferred
by copyists.
