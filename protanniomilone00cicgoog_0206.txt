. TRIAL OF THE Τ WO TRIBUNES. 131

April, the συχνοί after him, and the tribunes in the January of the next
year. Plutarch is more definite. He mentions first the accusation
brought against Metellus Scipio, which of course was prior to Aug. 1,
then the condemnation of Plancus, after whztlr (ὀλίγαις ὕστερον ἡμέραις)
Hypsaeus was accused ¹. ' No one, however, supposes that Hypsaeus was
tried in 51, since iu his case there was no reason for delay. lt is
obvious that Plutarch also, rightly or wrongly, conceived that the two
tribunes figured among the multitude of'persons brought to trial while
Pompey was sole-consul.

That the statement of Dio Cassius previously quoted is not due to
carelessness or inaccuracy of expression is clear from another passage,
in which, speaking of events in the earlier part of 53 rac, he says that ’
Rufus, one of the two tribunes in question, was already in office ². His
story is very definite. The consuls that year were elected ἑβδόμῳ μηνί,
and would not have been elected even then, unless Quintus Pompeius
Rufus καίτοι τοῦ τε Σύλλου θυγατριδοῦς ὢν καὶ δημαρχῶν had been imprisoned·
A sen. cons. threatening others who acted in the same way with similar
. penalties was passed, and Pompey was entrusted with the task of
carrying it out. ,The tribunes, he says, ἐκώλυον τὰς λοιπὰς ἀρχὰς αἱρεθῆναι,
and themselves usurped the fonctions of the other magistrates Ac·

¹ cording then to the conception of Dio, Pompeius Rufus, and with him Ι

. Plancus and the other tribunes, whom we know to have been in office in
the· earlier part of 52, were also in office in the middle of 53, instead
dffentering this on Dec. 10, 53 as is generally supposed. In order
to avoid this conclusion it is usual to suppose that Dio made a mistake
and called Rufus tribune, when he was only deszgnalus. This, however,
does not suit the context. Dio goes on to narrate that Rufus afterwards
imprisoned FavoniuS, then curule aedile, i. e. in virtue of his prenrio
(Aul. Gell. xiii. 12) as tribune. The story has been doubted, because it
is thought unlikely that a tribune would have been subiected to such
indignity during his year oi office. The act, itis true, was a re-
volutionary oue, but the circumstances were also exceptional. A caup
(Μαί was necessary in order to restore order. The moz'eslas trz'bum'cz'ul
had been so frequently disregarded that the senate may well have
ventured to go one step further. With reference to the credibility ol
Dio it must be remembered that his information for this period is
considered very good by modern critics, who generally think that it is
derived from the lost books of Livy ⁴.
