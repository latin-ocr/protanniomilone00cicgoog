THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xliii ·

from each other, went on from avery early date ¹. On the other hand
both MSS. have a lacuna in § 102, and Ι suspect that in 8 69 both insert

a word by conjecture [see note aa' loc.]. In 8 42 the variants point
to a dislocation of the text in both families. A proprius error which is
undoubtedly significant, occurs in 8 52, where for Rama exiturum both
MSS. give Romam exr't.². Minor cases are§56.iis: bis. §78.arbitretur: -
arbitraretur. 867. audire: exaudire. The list would be added to, if
some emendations proposed in this edition are accepted. I do not
here mention such cases as 8 52. praedicatam: 8 78. possesse'ones; 888.
devinctum, since these are capable of defense: while arbas, 8 79, is
probably an original spelling. On the whole it appears to be the safest
conclusion that H and T are not of the same stock‚ though it would be
untrue to assert that the strains had always been kept apart.

l now come to a somewhat thorny question, sc. the relation of our P·[pslimp-
MSS. to the fragments of P, the palr'rnpsestus Taurinensis. This does ηεῗὲζζίἷῗῶ
not agree exclusively with either lamily. Thus it gives with H, 8 72.
abrogavit: abrogabit E, abrogabat T. 8 73. materiem: materiam TE.
875. cessissent: cessisset ΤΕ. 886. a iudicibus: am. a TE. 888.
potentiam suam esse: pat. suam esse potentiam TE. 8 92· ipsos: apsi TE.
§93. propter: per TE. On the other hand it agrees with TE against
five readings of H, the first of which is of absolutely first-rate importance;
sc.§74. arma: barerusra H. §75. minitatus: mehatus H. §9aservarez
seruari H. § 9 3. valeant, inquit, valeant cives mei : valeant valeant, risque't,
mer'czbes, valeant H. ' 8 95. hoc eodem: bac eadem ι’ζίο H. If P is con·
sidered an infallible witness to the truth‚ these and similar readings will
be looked upon as wilful alterations in H. As, however, many of these
variants found only in H are in themselves extremely attractive, we
shall be justified in examining more narrowly the credentials ol P. The
extreme value attached to it is somewhat recent. Orelli calls it very
corrupt—[‘ Peyronus nimio corruptissimi Palimpsesti Taurinensis amore
abripi se passus est ’]. The opposite view is put most strongly by
Dn Nohl, who says that it ‘solus saepe Ciceronis verba servavit, ubi non
modo codd. peccant, sed etiarn Quintilianus’: cf. 8 94 n. The truth
would seem to lie between these opinions· I add some cases in which P
appears to me certainly in the wrong.

839. seris: add. ettam beluis, P. How any critic can digest this, is
more than I can tell. l refer to my note.

849. illi, illi, inquit, tui: no one follows P, which omits the second

¹ Eg. in the de Senectute P is corrected from L and L from P: Auecdot. p. xx.
¹ So also E. The error survives in a, and was only expelled by the scholars os the

fifteenth century.
