TRIAL OF THE TWO TRIBUNES. 133

. been vz'tr'o creati. Also, obnuntiatio might be employed either by a
tribune, or by a higher magistrate. An augur could also report nn-
favourable omens, or state the occurrence of a orizam. The only checlr
upon the use of these means os obstruction lay in the good feeling or
public spirit⁶of those who were qnalified to act thus. Mommsen says,
‘the plebs and their leaders apparently avoided the consequences, which
might have followed from the use of the oblativa auspiciu, and which
actually followed in the case of the meetings of the populus1.' It is
obvious that at this period such consideratione might cease to exercise
a restraining influence. I think it possibly worth while‘to mention that
one of the consuls for 54, Appius Claudius Pulcher, may have had
an interest in delaying the election of tribunes for the following year.
He could not obtain alex curtata, which it was customary for a
proconsul to have passed in his behalf before going to his province ².
This was of course due to the fact that the passage of this was vetoed
by a 'tribune If, however, the election of new tribunes were delayed
by the means which it was in his power to employ, he would be able
to get his lex curz'ata passed after the obstructionists had gone out of
office on Dec. ro. In view of this conjecture it is interesting to note
that, upon his retum from Cilicia in 51, he was arraigned for marisiae ³.
The question as to who would convene the plebeian assembly, if there
were no tribunes, is one that is wrapped in the deepest obscurity. One
occasion, when the difficulty must certainly have arisen, is in 449 ac,
after the termination of the decemvirate ⁴. This, however, is a subject
which I do not feel myself competent to discuss. The point upon which
Ihere desire to lay stress is that the explanation advanced above is the
only one which agrees with the statements of our various authorities for
the events of this year.

⁴ Livy iii. 54 states that on this occasion a sen. cons. was passed ut . . . Q. Furius
pontifex maximus tribunos plebi crearet. A similar statement was made by Cicero
in his speech pro Cornelio (Ascon. 77) dacem tr. pl. per pontificem, quod magistratus
nullus erat, creavemnt. Asconius, who does not question the accuracy of the state-
ment, says that the pontifex was named M. Papirius. To reject contemptuously so
well-attested a tradition, became it conflicts with our notione respecting the tribunate,
as was formerly done by Mommsen, appears to me to savonr of dogmatism.
