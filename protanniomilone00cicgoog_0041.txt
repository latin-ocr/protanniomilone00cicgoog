xxx . PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

puts it, by the way of preparation for actual encounter in the courts ¹.
In this he took up the position that the murder of Clodius, which he did
not deny‚ was justified hythe good results thereby accruing to the public
weal ; a bold theory, which would enable him to air a number of Stoical
paradoxes. Cicero, not to be outdone, composed the oration which we
possess, in which he developed the same line of defence as that which he
had previously argued in court, that Clodius was the aggressor. We
do not know the exact time of the publication, but without doubt it was
after Aug. 1, and before May in the following year, when he went to
Cilicia ⁹. ·

Milo's property was put up to auction after his departure, and purchased
bya syndicate of friends, who wished to realise it as far as possible in
his interest ³. His debts amounted to the enormous sum of 70‚000,000
sesterces; a record ligure in the annals of Roman bankruptcy, upon which
the syndicate undertook to pay a small fraction. Among those who took
part in this transaction was Cicero himself, or more probably Terentia,
represented by her freedman Philotimus. There is evidence from the
letters of Cicero, couched in enigmatical and mysterious terms‚ that
Philotimus ‘cooked his accounts,’ and that Milo expressed great dis·
satisfactioni The suspicion that Cicero made money out of his friend
isa monstrous one, but a modern writer has not hesitated to bring this
odious charge against him ⁵. It is, however, wholly alien to his nature,
and his correspondence shows that he was wounded to the quick by the
knavery of Philotimus. At the same time his position was very delicate,
since Terentia was probably compromised in the transaction. It was
not the first trouble in which he had been entangled by his domineering
and grasping wife ⁸.

In the civil war Milo originally took no part. He was estranged from
Pompey‚ while Caesar had always been his adversary. The latter, how-

He refers to the trial, and quotes words from this speech in the de optimo genere
oratorum,a tract assigned to this year. There are striking similarities of thought
and laugnage in passages of the de Legibus, which also belongs to this period.

³ This was suggested by C. Duronius, a friend of Milo. It was hoped by a friendly
liquidation to reserve to Milo a number of slaveS, whom he had taken with him to
Massilia, aod to saleguard the interests of Fausta, who had advanced money to him
from her estate: Ate v. 8. ν, 10. 4.
