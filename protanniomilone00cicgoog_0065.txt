A szgnum is evidence to show adonta perficiendi faculhtas Of this
there are six main varieties: „pocus tempus, spatium, occasio, spes
perficiendi, spiri5 corelad‘r ,uAn ”irgumentum rs evidence drawn from the
behaviour of a person, before, during, or after the actl.

An argumentum against Clodius is that three days before he said to
Favonius that Milo had only three days to live. This leads one to
consider :—

[α] strenus-li 45, 51·

(ἱ) The dayl. Milo was forced to leave Rome on the 18th, Clodius
was required at Rome on that day for a meeting. Clodius could easily‘v
know that Milo would be travelling ont the 18th. Milo could not know“‘
this of Clodius since, according to the evidence of the latter’s friends, he
had not intended to travel at all, but to spend the night of the 18th ιιι his
tvtlla. This evidence clears Milo, since he could have had no knowledge.

’9506 It does not, however, clear ClodiuS, since the statement was merely
a blind He was waiting for Milo, and carne out to attach him.

ιι) (The haur Why should Clodius start on a journey just before ι

ῥιψὶ fall? No explanation can be' given, unless that he wished to waylay

,pit ilo If Milo, however, had intended to waylay Clodius, his obvious
gisi? course was to wait till the latter was near Rome, and to slay him under
sl ⁰⁵40&ss ecover of night. The only other alternative was to kill him before he

'dmi' dx reached his villa at all, when on his way from Aricia.
Cy The arguments thus far used are now restated ιιι a series of
θ antitheses under thef orm ο fsrequentatrbfi The probabile ex causa and

ex vita3 the day and the hour of the occurrence all divert suspicion from .
’· Milo, and cast it on Clodius, § 52.

' [b] Locus ἕξ 53, 54.
On this the advocate rightly lays the greatest stress. It was just before

the estate ol Clodius, where he had a thousand men employed, and on

rising ground that the fray took place. If the encounter were represented

in a picture, a glauce would tell us who was the aggressor.
