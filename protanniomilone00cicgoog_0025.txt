Ι xiv PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

Istue preceding remarks are correct, there is no evidence that any one
was prosecuted except those persons directly implicated in the events ol
53 and 52. If, however, the statements of Appian are upheld, it still

· remains that we know of no one who was tried lor misdeeds surther back

than 54. There is nothing in the record of cases to justily the statement,
that the retrospective action ol the law extended to 70.

The mistake probably arose in the following manner. The law ol
Pompey was criticized at the time as being retrospective. Thus Cato
urged ‘let byegones be byegones¹.’ Later writers, wishing to explain
‘retrospective,' fixed the second consulship of Pompey in 55 as the
limit². Appian first of all confused the second consulship with the first,
and then proceeded to invent the story that the measure was aimed
at Caesar, and that the friends of the latter protested against such an
'action ll so, this, in connexion with his other blunders, throws a curious
light upon his methods as a historian.

The leverish anarchy which prevailed at Rome throughout this period
was without doubt the most significant ol the many alarming symptoms
which pointed to the speedy dissolution os the Republican system· The
maintenance ol public order was entirely neglected by the state, or
rather was not recognized as a matter which concerned the executive.
The individual had totale the law into his own hands. A Roman built
his house to stand a siege, and when he went about the streets was
accompanied by an armed retinue. The magistrates, so far srom
endeavouring to suppress disorder, were themselves the chiel offenders,
the problem for the ‘practical politician’ of the day being how to hold
the place of assembly against his rivals, while his hired gangs met in the
name of the Roman people, and made binding throughout the civilized
world any proposal, however mad or flagitiouS, which he cared to bring
forward. The leading part in this camival of misrule naturally fell to
the tribune, who, in virtue ol the sanctity ol his person, enjoyed the
singular privilege ol being able to assault any other magistrate, while the
injured person¹ was unable to retaliate. Ι

Under these circumstances rioting became chronic at Rome. ln
a well-known passage³ Cicero describes a memorable party-light, which
