variants: sc. in ξ 53 for praedicatam it has in the margin al. praedictam,
a conjecture afterwards made by Gruter, and in ξ 64, over an erasure,
gives framearum, afterwards read by Lambinus. Both readings are due

, is a very late MS, probably of the sixteenth century. Though vulgar in
basis, it contains several interesting readings doubtless due to conjecture,
eg. ξ 17. interfectus est, so Madvig, §aa Marce Favoni0, so Krause.
§43 am. audaciae, so Ferrarius and Garatoni. ξ 92. in infimi, so rece.
edd. ξ 99.- erupimus, so Lambinus iu mg.

The exclusion of s from the list of authoritative MSS. much simplifies
the problem‚ since we are now left with the four German MSS, and the
fragments of P, the relationship of which I proceed to discuss. To begin

worWer· with W, the Werdensis, now lost.

dem· Our information concerning this comes chiefly from F. Fabricius, who
· in 1569 published an edition of the pra fidelem and the de Pram‘ncr'e‘s
Consularibus. The book is a rare one. The copy, which I myself
consulted in the library at Heidelberg, once belonged to Graevius.
Fabricius says that he had himself previously collated the MS. in
Saxony, and sent some readings to Lambinus, for the use of that scholar
in his second edition. Owing‚ however, to the delay in the publication of
this, he added some notable readings to the above-mentioned edition,
which was then being printed at Diisseldorf. His work is dedicated to
the owner of the MS. D. Paulus Bruin, his readings being specimens,
unde tm'beneficr‘imugm'tuda, tamquam ex ungue lea, cognosceretur. Bruin
was at this timea pastor at Werden, near Diisscldorf, and had brought
the MS. with him from Sarrony. Lambinus was highly impressed by
these readings, and in the notes to his posthumous edition frequently
quotes this Saxanr'cus perantiquus, and says that all the emendations
peculiar to this edition are taken from it. His opinion of its merits was
not unnatural, since this was the first occasion upon which a member of
the mulceres became accessible to scholars¹. Unfortunately, however, we
cannot be sure to what variants he refers, unless he expressly mentions
the MS. in his notes, on account of the reckless manner in which such
symbols as a. c. [vetus codex]‚ or L. [Lambinus] are used by the sciolus,
who, aiter the death of this great scholar, mangled his work under the

pretence of editing it.

The MS. was also used by Gulielmius, who does not, however, quote

¹ In my Aneedoton I thought that Lambinus had obtained readings taken directly
from H. I now think it more probable that these came from some such MS. ns
h or s, into which they had entered iu the manner explained above.
