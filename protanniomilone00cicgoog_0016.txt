PREFACE. v

Since the appearance· of my Anecdoton, several editions of
this speech have been published. Mr. Poynton was the first to
adopt some important readings taken from the Harleian MS.
Mr. Colson‚ who reprints Miiller’s text, discusses in an Appendix
a number of the variants to which Ι had called attention.

I have found much that is useful in these scholarly works. '

Dr. Nohl has added to his new edition of Richter-Eberhard
a discussion of the Harleian MS. and adopts some of its
readings, although he is not prepared to admit the supremacy
which Ι had in my Anecdoton claimed for it. Dr. Reid's
edition appeared when my own notes were written and ready
for the press. I need hardly say that, if I had known at an
earlier period that he was engaged upon this speech,I should
have shrunk from appearing to compete with so well-known
a scholar. If my own work had not then reached'so advanced
a stage, my references to him would have been more frequent.
lwas pleased to find that in two passages [hh 56, 63] readings⁵
at which Ι had myself arrived, also commended themselves to
him. I must here thank all these editors for their generous
references to myself.

I have been very fortunate in the help which Ι have received
from various friends. Foremost among these is Mr. Louis
C. Purser, of Trinity College, Dublin, who has allowed me to
consult him continually when Ι was in difficulty, and has given
me advice, the value of which was only equalled by the modesty
with which it was offered. For his sympathy and unselhshness
in thus putting at my disposal his wide knowledge and sound
judgment I cannot sufficiently thank him. In several places
Ι acknowledge suggestions of his, while in many others he has
corrected mistakes of mine, or shown me that Ι was upon the
wrong track. It is only fair to him to say that in some cases
he does-not agree with a view which I advocate. Ι mention
¹this in order that I may alone be criticized for my errors.
I have' also to thank Dr. C. Ο. Zuretti, of Milan, for his great
kindness in making for me a most minute and elaborate col-
lation of the palimpsest [P] Mr. J. L. Strachan-Davidson, of
