HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xix

a riot, I foresee that Milo will kill him with his own hands He has no
hesitation3 he does not hide his intention; he does not fear my fate ¹.' In
view of this frank statement made five years before, there can be no doubt
of the murderous intentioris of Milo. Nor was Clodius less outspoken.
1t three days before his own murder he prophesied the speedy death of
Milo, we may be sure that this was not the first time he had avowed his
determination to rid himself ‘or his fierce antagonist.

Once embarked upon the cursus honorum, Milo naturally expected to
go on. We know nothing of his praetorshtp². He appears to have
held the office in 55 ac, a year in which it was not possible to signalize
himself. ln 53 he appeared as a candidate for the consulship of 52.

The candidature of lllilo must have been highly inconvenient to
Pompey, who at this particular time was playing a very subtle game‚
in which the advancement of Milo formed no part. His object was to
become dz'ctalor ; and to secure this end, if he did not foment the anarchy,
he allowed things to drift, until the evil should become intolerable. In
the middle of 54 the dictatorship of Pompey was already ‘in the air³,’
and from time to time the report that the great man wished to have the
office offered to him was circulated by the band of ‘confidanrs⁴,’ whose
' business it was to divine the secret desires of their shy and hypocritical
master. What he really wished was hard to tell. ‘Pompey says plainly
that he does not want to be dictator: previously in speaking to me, he
did not say “ no.” Hirrus appears likely to make the proposal. Heavens‚
how fatuous he is' [sc. Pompey], ‘lost in adoration of himself, a lover
without a rival... Whether he wants it, or wants it not, is not easy
to say. Still is Hirrus proposes it, he will not be able to convince people
that he does not want it⁶.’ In 53 the moment might seem to have
arrived, since no electioris at all could be held on account of the disorder.
Pompey however was in no hurry, and, when he appeared upon the
scene, condescended to quiet the storm, and consuls were elected for the
remaining portion os the year. For the next year he put forward two
nominees of his own-Q. Metellus Scipio, whose daughter he afterwards
married, and Hypsaeus, one of his ‘confidants' How far he was
sincere in the support he gave¹ thern, must remain uncertain. His
devotion to Hypsaeus, whom in the following year he surrendered to
the enemy, was probably but half-hearted⁰. In any case his influence
