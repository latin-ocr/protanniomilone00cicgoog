xxxiv PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

(iii) Digby,19[b],fifteenth century, thoroughly vulgar in basis, but
highly corrected, and containing in the margin a number of additions in
a contemporary hand, which can only have been taken lrom a German

The affinity of ς to a may be shown by some proprii errores. Iquote
a few from the early part of the speech :5-

§ 1. cum ι enne consul σ, cum ,cet s. § 2. quidem: on. os sol. § 3. exitum
iudici: one. exitum o, sup. lin. after iud. s. § 12. decernere: re decernere
a, in ς reis given sup. lin. hythe first hand. § 13. umquam: orn. a, sup.
lin. s. § 25. esse orn. a, sup. lin. ς. 5 34. augebatur: frangebatur os sol.

It ic, however, with χ that s is most closely connected. I note the fol-
lowing 3 where no comment is made the reading italicised is common to

the two MSS:-
’ 5 13. senatui oen, but added sup. lin. after enim, ib. umquam sup. lin.
522. legendis: eligendis. 5 22. te before praeesse. § 28. et vestimenta:
et orn. χ, sup. lin. s. § 31. putasset: sup. lin. § 32· iam orn. χ, sup. lin. s.
§ 33. tribunatus on. χ, add. s in ng. ib. unum esse: on. unum, odd. esse
rublan. 535. homine: nornine. §41. vos et omnes: one. et. §59. pro-
pius quarn tum: proprias quonium. 563. eum (before tanti): on. χ,
sup. lin. s. 572. eum . . . censuit on. 577. acervicibus vestris: om.
χ, in mg. ς. 584. plane: sane. 593. intersum: arsum. §1oo. ego
meum: et meum.
, The above are sufficient proofs of consanguinity. That s contains
a later form of the recension than χ is apparent, since in it obvious cor·
ruptions disappear, e. g. § 46. Interamnae: enter arna χ, interamna s.

The basis ol s being vulgar ¹, or of the a type, while in species it
resembles χ, it is differentiated from other MSS. of the same family by
the fact that it contains additions and variants characteristic ol the
moleiras. That these have come inab extro,and have been grafted upon
the vulgar stock, would naturally be surmised, and the conjecture is con·
firmed when we find in the margin of the Oxsord fifteenthcenturyb
precisely the same readings entered by a contemporary hand. Some of
the corrections are common to HTE, e. g. § 60. bens tu, &c ; 586. adri.
decoris; 5 91. ad Castorist that, however, they were drawn from H, and
not from TE, is clear from the following characteristic readings of H,
found also in the margin of b and the text ol s.

¹ To avoid misconception,1 add that the purification of s from the faults of the
dett. is only skin deep. Thus in 5 36 it has the usual dislocation. Other char-
acteristic marks are 5 12. cnm bonis: eune malni. 5 22. insidias: insanias.
525. coloniam. 528. add. onlgns before magno. 529. re vera: ita esse. 532.
sperasset. 533. nefarie: necessarie. 547. videlieet me. 551. ut: nisi. 553. om.
edito. 568. imadisset. 582. contribuendo.
