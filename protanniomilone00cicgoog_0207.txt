The suggestion which will naturally present itself to the mind of the
reader is that in the general anarchy, which prevailed at this period,
the election of tribunes had become dislocated, and that the college of
tribunes to which Rufus and Plancus belonged came into office early
in 53 nc, going out at the corresponding time in 52. This hypothesis
reconciles at once all the difficulties alluded to. In May or June 52,
Cicero would naturally speak of the multituda et celebritas r'rrdr'crbrum,
Dio may well be correct in placing the trial of the συχνοί after that of
Rufus and Plancus, and Plutarch in representing that the case of
Hypsaeus carne after theirS.

It may he asked, ‘What is meant by the reference to a possible inter·
calation, made by Cicero in the letter previously quotedi' In reply
to this, Ι would point out that Pompey apparently wished to complete
his task by Aug. 1. For this there were two reasons. In the first
place he modelled his conduct upon that of the dictator, who held office
for six months only. Secondly, it is well known that the last five months
of the year were occupied by lade, during which it was not usual for
the courts to sit, although it is true that an exception had been previously
madain trials for arii. In his wish to complete the trials before August
he may have threatened to insert an intercalary month³. The autumn
vacation would thereby be delayed, and with it -Cicero's visit to his
friend.

Iam well aware that there is a grave constitutional difficulty in the
way of this otherwise simple explanation. Roman law made no pro-
vision in. the case of the tribunate corresponding to the interregnum,
which ensued when there were no consuls· It was therefore a heinous
offence plebem re'rze tribunis relinquere& At the same time it is un-
doubted that the meetings of the cancr'lium plebis, in which the tribunes
were elected, might he broken up by the methods which are so familiar
in connexion with the camitra. The plebeian assembly might be dss-
solved if thunder were heard3 an omen which the tribune was bound
to take due notice of. The tribunes elected might be declared to have

prodigies and omens in these books is highly characteristic of Livy.

³ Cf. the very interesting passage, Verr. ii. 1²9· Verres, by an abuse of the system
of dier ἐξαιρέσιμοι, took a month and a half out of the year at Cephaloedium, so that
the inhabitants afterwards had to insert mensem intercalarium xlv dier longum·
If he could have done this at Rome, expugnasset iste, ut dies xlv inter br'reas ludes
tolleretur, per quas solas iudicium fieri posset. This would have been exactly opposite
to the course, which, on this hypothesis, Pompey threatened to adopt.
