his notes as having taken place at about this period. The first persons
condemned according to him are-Mller ἐπὶ Κλωδίου φόνῳ καὶ Γαβίνιος
παρανομίας ὁμοῦ καὶ ἀσεβείας ὅτι χωρίς ψηφίσματος ἔα Αἴγυπτον μετὰ στρατιᾶς
ἐσέβαλεν ἀπαγορευόντων τῶν Σιβυλλείων [he. for maiestas and caerimoniae
violatae} He adds that the goods of Gabinius were also confiscated
(δήμευσις ἦν ἐπὶ τῇ φυγῇ). The facts about Gabinius are well known. He

was first accused of mar'estas in 54 and acquitted‚ mainly in consequence
of Pompey’s exertions, who put pressure upon individual jurymen and

threw out hints ofa dictatorship ¹. A full account of the trial is given by
Dio, from which it appears that the arguments were mainly concerned
with the count of caerimoniae uiolatae ². He was then accused of extor-
tion and condemned. That Pompey was no less eamest in his behalf on
this occasion may be judged from the fact that he forced Cicero to defend

him, a humiliation to which he had previously refused to stoop in face of
the greatest pressure. The hypothesis of Zumpt, who supposes that—as

confiscation of property did not follow ina suit for extortion—he was
again arraigned in his absence upon the charge of impiety‚ aud con·
demned‚ is altogether untenable³. What motive could Pompey have for
attacking in this vindictive manner his old friend and lieutenant?

I dwell upon these blunders of Appian since there is one strange state·
ment of his to which undue credence has been given. In describing the
law of Pompey de anthim, he says that it embraced all offences committed
since his first consulship in 703 a provision which alarmed Caesar's
friends, who saw in it a menace to him. Mommsen accepts this state-
ment without question, as do all the most recent authorities Ι regard it
as very improbable. Asconius says nothing of any such provision. Itt
is unlilrely that Pompey would wish his own dirty linen to be washed in
public. He was himself accustomed to win elections by the methods
which Philip of Macedon found irresistible when attacking fortresses,
namely, by the use of his money bags ⁴. Nor could he have passed such
ameasure through the senate, in which there was no one, not even the
honest Cat0, whose past career would enable him to throw the first stone ⁶.
A still more convincing argument is to be found in the fact that we hear
of no one tried whose misdeeds went further back into the past than 54.
It is, I think, exceedingly doubtful whether any one was tried at all,
