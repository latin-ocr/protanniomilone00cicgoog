ST YLE AND COMPOSITION OF THE SPEECH. li

where the speaker calls attention to the unusual circumstances attending
the trial ; cf. the pro Rab. Perd. and pro Rege Deiotaro. After first-
(α) Securing the attentum of the jurorS, Cicero makes every eff0rt to

’ gain-

(b) Their good-will. This is done according to rule ¹.
(ι) Α suupersonc: ξ 1, sc. his own fears.
(a) Ab auditorum p.: ὁ) a, 3, sc. Pompey, the army and the
multitude.
(3) Ab adversariarum p.: ξ 3, the character of the Clodrizni.
(4) Α rebus t'ytsts: ξ( 4, 5, the patriotic policy of Milo, with whom
Cicero associates himself.
(c) He then rapidly sketches the summa causae, in order to se'cure the
docilitas of his hearers: namely, rusticitius Milom'a Clodzirfactas.
Before, however, entering into a discussion of the facts it is necessary to
remove three suppositions fatal to his client ².
(ἰί) Praeiudioia. RE? υτ n s 0 bl
(α) ‘The sels-confessed shedder of blood is condemned already?
This is not so, since homicide is sometimes justifiable³z as is shown
§t 7-11·
(ι) From legend, the story of Horatius,
(a) From history, the execution of conspirators.
(3) From fiction, the murder of his mother by Orestes.
(4) From recent events, the story of the soldier who killed his
officer.
(5) From the unwritten law of nature, and the written law of man,
which sanction homicide in self-defence.
(b) ‘The senate has decided that the murder was contra rempublicam!
That it did not thereby show itself hostile to Milo is proved out of the
accusers' own mouths, since they complaiu that the senate merely acts to
register the wishes of Cicero. All violence in a free state is contra remp,
even violence in the cause of order. The senate agreed with Cicero in
wishing for an enquiry into the facts, but did not contemplate these novel
proceedings (ὁ) 1²·14]·
(c) ‘Pompey has condemned Milo already.'

nostrorum, ab auditorum persona, ab rebus ipsis: Herenn. l. c.

¹ Quintil. iv. ii. 25, ib. v. ii.

⁸ Cicero is here arguing the general question that homicide is sometimes justifiable.
This is iuridicialis constitutio absoluta. ln such acase we must ask iurene sitfactum.
To decide this it is necessary to ask of what ius consists. Constat igitur ex his
partibus: natura, lege, ccruuetudine iudicato, aequo ct bono, pacto: Herenn. ii. 19.
