x PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

nothing new is to be obtained. He seems to regard the murder ol
Clodius as an incident in the sole-consulship of Pompey, instead of the
immediate cause which brought it about. This was natural, since the
results were so important as to dwarf the accident which made them
possible. The one original statement which he makes, that Cato
voted lor the acquittal of lllilo, is a bold one, since the more cautious
Asconius reports that he could not obtain any certain information upon
the subject.

(iv) 'rho Scholiasta Bobienais (saecl. ivlv); a name given to
what appears to be a corpus of scholia ol different date and value.
The composite character os these is readily seen. Thus the sacrilege
ol Clodius is described both in the Argument to the dc Aere olz'eno
Milonis, and also in a note to the same speech, the two accounts
being clearly due to separate writers. So on ξ 14 of this speech, dz'az'sa
centenno est is* erroneously explained, whereas the reference in the Argu·
ment agrees with the account given by Asconius. The relation of these
scholia to Asconius has been frequently discussed. Gaumita¹ holds that
they are wholly independent [ι er hdchst wahrscheinlich dessen (sc. Ascon.)
Kommentar zur Miloniana gar nicht kannte']. This opinion he bases
upon certain divergencies, notably the different explanations given ol the
previous conduct attributed to Domitius [ξ 22]. I show in my note that
the discrepancy is in reality a very slight one, since they both referto
action taken by him against the same Manilius. To me it appears
that the Scholiast is sometimes paraphrasing Asconius while on other
occasions he misunderstands him. Thus when Asconius says of Pompey
that he was sitting ad aerariam, ie. in front of the temple of Saturn, the
Scholiast expands this, and says przino quziiem tiadz'ces consederunt in aede
Saturni. His statement that Clodius fled metu peragitolus . . . in cau·
penulam is an imaginative one, while his reference to Pompey as being
then consul without a colleague is at least misleading. On the whole,
except as containing scraps lrom earlier authorities, and probably from
Asconius, I should not be inclined to attach much importance to these
scholia, at least so lar as this speech is concerned.

We have also detailed accounts in three Greek writers, whom I take in
order ol importance.

(v) Plutarch refers to the trial and events connected with it in his
lives ol Cicero, chs. 33-35, Cato minor, 47-48, Pompey, 54-55, and
Caesar, 28. He gives us a good deal of independent information, and
consulted original documents. In his life ol Cicero he refers eg. to
