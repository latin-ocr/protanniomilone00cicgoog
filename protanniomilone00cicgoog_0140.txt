for the meaning, ‘timber,' cf. Verr. i.

Vitruvius, ii. ch. ix. The alnus was the
best wood for piles, and lasted for ever in
marshy gronnd; e. g. the whole of Ravenna
was built in this way. Clodius, when

' building on an island, would probably

begin by siuking piles. Timber would
also be required to form the ‘longwooden
box, into which the concrete was poured’
[Middleton, i. p. 47].

had a thorongh knowledge of building,
is here enumerating the materials used
in concrete, structura caenrmticia; cf.
Middleton, i. p. 44 sq, and Vitruvius,
ii. ch. vii. The best kinds of stone were
lapis Albanus, the modern peperino‚ and
lap. tibertinus, sc. travertine. In making
concrete, broken lumps of these were
mixed with lime.
