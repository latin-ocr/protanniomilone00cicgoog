THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THIS EDITION. lix

difficult to see why one of several alternative forms should be exclusively
used. Thus, for the dat. or abl. plural of is the Romans used under the
Republic eir, rezi, zizi, and is, while iis appeared under the Empire¹.
Dr. Reid selects eis as Cicero's form. ln such an inscription, however,
as that recording the performance of the Ludi Saeculares under Augustus
which is likely to have been composed with great care, ieri is exclusively
used. The dat. of qui in the same inscription is always quoi, a form
which is said to have been generally used until the middle of the first
century anst It would be easy to multiply examples. Further‚ any
system which is uniform—and to my mind uniformity is above all
necessary-must be to some extent conventional‚ since the evidence shows
that the same person did not adhere to one system. Thus in the in·
scription previously referred to we find z'nperare, ramolam, but imperator,
complures ,¹ aheneus and uenator, loediand ludi, &ci A Roman allowed
himself to vary his orthography‚ but with the means at our disposal we
cannot possibly say when he used one form and when another.

Ἴ Under these circumstances l have taken refuge in a compromise by
adopting as a basis the orthography ol Nohl. This is frankly conven-
tional, and has been praised by Dr. Landgraf on account of its approach
to uniformity ⁴. l have ventured to introduce some modifications Thus,
I print always poenire, poenirz', pacatior (cf.§ 9 for the MSS. evidence),
and monimentum (cf.§ 18 n). In ξ 94 Ι give optuli with PHT since
otherwise a Ciceronian assonance is lost, and ξ 98 >ommutesce a rarer
spelling, from H. Also I print throughout -ί, not -z'i, as the genitive
singular of nouns whose nominative ends in -z'us or aiem. As Dr. Reid
remarks, ‘the fact that some of our MSS. preserve the original form in
as many cases as one in live is utterly incapable of explanation on the
supposition that the form used by Cicero was that in -izl'
