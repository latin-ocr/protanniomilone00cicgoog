orthography which Cicero used! There appear to me to be difficulties
in the way of either system.

To take first that of C. F. W. Mtiller. He generally follows E
(xiisxiii cent), but sometimes adopts a spelling from T (xi cent), and
where P (prob. vsvi. cent.) is exstant, generally follows it. The result is
a curious mixture. Thus in ξ 35 he gives mprobos, finding this spelling
attributed to Pin Baiter¹s notes; but elsewhere romolus. As amatter
of fact P has improb. here also, the statement ol Baiter being due to an
erroneous inference. He prints abpune always but in § 39 ziupunilale,
where, however, HT give r'npuu also. In ξ 45 he has adproperare! with
E, but in ξ 48 appropinquare, again following E. The other spelling
adprop. is, however, here found in H. Generally he omits s after ex in
words like exspectatura 49 has exspectandum. This apparently is not
a printer’s error, but due to the fact that E, which generally omits s, here
retains it (H gives expect.)¹. ln ξ 16 he gives illato with E, but a lew
lines further has oblata, also with E (H has vialata in both places). This
variety is very bewildering to a reader. While I do not dispute that
Cicero may have varied his practice, Iwould urge that the evidence of
our MSS. is of little value in regard to such mrbulrire. Thus in ξ 92 the
palimpsest gives inploro immediately after implorat. Is not this obviously
due to accident, rather than to a genuine traditioni If, however, this
applies to a really ancient Ms. such as P, a fortiori it is true ol a late
MS. such as E. Anyone who has handled tenth· or eleventh-century
MSS. is aware that in them such spellings as e. g. abluto, inploro, and the
like, are systematically altered to all. and ziupl. by the second hand, the
alteration being generally reproduced in later MSS. of the same stocln
Such varieties then as those in E are, in all probability, due to the
vagaries of a corrector, and do not deserve serious attention.

The second system, that of Dr. Reid, is one to which Iam much
attracted. I have, however, not seen my way to adopt it on this occasion.
ln the first place, this edition is largely concerned with textual questions,
and I do not like to so lar desert the MSS. as to print e. g. nouom,
avonculus, propritcus, and the like. 1 also suspect that more extensive
changes will be necessary if we endeavour to arrive at the orthography
which Cicero actually used. To take a simple case. We are expressly
told by Quintil. (i. 7. ao) that Cicero wrote caussa, cassus, duzisr‘o, &c.,
‘as was shown by writings in his hand! Dr. Reid formerly printed
caussa, but in his edition of this speech has returned to causa. I certainly
do not think that public opinion is yet ripe for cassus and drausio, yet
the evidence lor these forms is unimpeachable ². Also, in some cases it is
