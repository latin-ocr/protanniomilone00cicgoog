HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xxxi

ever, took pains to keep him quiet by dilating upon the violence of the
measures by which he had been driven into exile ¹: while it was generally
reported by his confidants that one nithe first measures he intended to
take was to restore all who had been exiled under the laws of Pompey ⁹.
Such expectations may have induced Milo to leave Massilia before its
siege. At any rate we hear nothing of any share taken by him in its
obstinate defence. The conqueror, however, was too wise to recall so
dangerous a man, and Milo was left alone, or almost alone, in exile,
frowned on alike by both parties. His return to Italy, to take part in the
abortive insurrection of CaeliuS, is highly characteristic of the man.

The light-hearted Caelius, who had become a Caesarian, not because
he liked his cause, but because he wished to be on the same side with
Curio, became, after the death of his friend, at once a Pompeian and an
anarchist. He chose the eve of Pharsalus to bring forward as praetor
measures of a fantastic character, conceived iu the spirit of his old friend
Catiline, providing a seven years’ moratoriam, and remitting aycar's rent to
all tenants of house-property. When the consul broke his curule chair and
the senate suspended him, his reason seems to have suffered from the
indignities which he had received, and he attempted to 'raise Italy against
Caesar. The cnterprise was a mad one, but he wrote to Milo, and Milo
promptly obeyed the call, bringing with him the remnantof bis gladiators.
This strangely-assorted pair, the bankrupt politician and the grim exile,
met, and then started upon their hopeless task. The end came quickly.
An attempt on Capua failed, and Milo went on in advance to raise aforce
of bandits from the slave-shepherds of Southern Italy. He perished at
Compsa, slain by a stone cast from the wall, while Caelius, after making
hie way to Thurii, was there killed by some Gallic and Spanish cavalry,
whom he was endeavouring to seduce from their allegiance to Caesar ³.

If we consider the instant recognition which the Mlonrizna obtained
asa masterpiece of oratorical composition, we cannot but be struck by
the paucity ol MSS. which possess any value for the settlement ol its text.
The mediaeval copyists were extremely capricious in their choice of works
for transcription, and it frequently happens that we have a wealth oi MSS.
containing writings of inferior interest, while others of great merit depend

⁸ I have not thought it necessary here to enter into the curious discrepaneies as to
the place and circumstances of Milo's death. The theory pnt forward by Kr‘a'ner iu
his note on Bell. Cir. iii. aa seems to offer the best solution of the difficulties.
