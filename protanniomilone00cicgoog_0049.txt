xxxviii PRO T. ANNIO MILONE.

ἕξ 1-15, and it is hardly credible that Gulielmius would not have referred
to it for anyof these speeches.

If W then may be set aside, not merely because its tradition is r
defective, but also because its loss is supplied by T, we are left with
HTE as the three MSS. of cardinal importance for the constitution of
the text ¹. 1 omit for the moment the fragments of Ρ. What is the
relative degree of credence to be attached to them? Modern critics

mtregem- decide unanimously, and with reason, against T. 1 would refer to

seensis] a valuable paper by Nohl in Hermes xxi. 195, and the preface to his
edition of 1888. He shows that it manifests an inclination to the vulgar
family, and stylesit the parens deteriorum. This phrase must not, however,
be taken too literally, since H and E also furnish material for the
formation of the inferior text. 1 quote the following as a sample :—

§5. equidem: et quz'dem He. ξ 7. disputant: desputant. obtereret H,
obiciunt σ. §a et iustissimi: ellestrz'ssime'Ed (etlusrntsim'que T). §64.
malleolorum: malleorum Ea

The mediaeval copyist was fatally attracted by an error wherever
found; the result being that the unemended dett. form a florilegium of
corruptions. That T, however, was the basis of the vulgar text will be
apparent from the critical notes. I give here three instances: ξ ²9· qui
animo fideli in dommum et praesenti fuerunt, T inserts erant before et ;
hence the corruption found in all the dett. ξ 89. oppressisset, bm T.
ᾗ 102. Ome infelicem, om. me, in each case being followed by all the dett.

The result of this analysis is to leave us with H and E, between which
the battle for supremacy has to be fought out. The difficulties which
exist chiefly arise from the fact that, although the good readings for which
E has been preferred to T are, witha few doubtful exceptionS, also found
in H, the latter MS. has a number of variants peculiar to itself, some of
which are obviously right, while others are so striking that, if not correct,
they must be due to wilful alteration. Gulielmius, who used the three
MSS. HWE, preferred H, an opinion afterwards held by Garatoni and
Madvig, who based their Judgment upon the scanty collation then in
existence. Baiter, on the other hand, decided in favour of E, and is
followed by recent editors, who vie with each other in their worship of
this MS. Thus C. F. W. Mtiller follows it even in minute points of
spelling, e. g.§ 16 he prints illata, and a few lines lower inlata with it.
Nohl, in his new edition of Richter-Eberhard, writing after the appearance
of my Anecdoton, though he adopts several readings from H, and
notably the most important of all, sc. § 46. om. cuius . . . Romae, declares

¹ This also applies to the de Imp. Cn. Pompei.
