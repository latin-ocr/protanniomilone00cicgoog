THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xlvii

scribe was copying more ancient originals than formerly ¹. These folios
contain the speeches before Caesar, pro Milone, de Imp. Cn. Pompei, ex-
cerpts from the Verrines, and de Officiis i, ii part. In the first of these the
MS. is a gemellus of A [Ambros. x cent.], in the Verrine selections it is
closely connected with R [Reg. Par. x cent.], in the de Officiis, with
B [Bamberg. x cent.], in all cases the best authorities ². That the pro
Milone and de Imp. Cn. Pompei are drawn from an equally good source
I cannot doubt. This part of the MS. then differs considerably from
that containing the Cato maior, Laelius, and speeches against Catiline,
to which I attribute little authority. I mention this, since in some of
the kindly notices received by my Anecdoton the distinction did not seem
to be realized ³.

As to the provenancc of the MS, that acute scholar L. Mendelssohn,
speaking of the Epp. ad Familiares the latter half of which it contains
has made the interesting guess that they may have been taken from

the MSS. which we know from the ancient catalogue to have existed at ⁴

Lorsch ⁴. In view of this conjecture it must not be forgotten that the
same library contained one of the three copies of the pro Milone mentioned
in the catalogues⁶. It is, therefore, not improbable that this portion of
the MS. was drawn from the same source.

Lastly, as to the character of its recension, what degree of authority can
be ascribed to thiS, our most reliable MS? Is it free from glosseS, or
interpolations? The answer is ‘certainly not' No MS. is, certainly no
vith cent. MS. Thus ξ 7 lor disputant it gives disputant. obiciant, and § 81
adds poleas after zizgratz'us, which Ι cannot but consider an interpolation.
The merit, however, which I would claim for it, is thatin it a corruptionis
frequently found in its rudimentary form, while in TE it has been disguised.
Thus -in ξ 102 it gives the unconstrueable grai [i. e. gratio] angentibus,
while TE disguise the lacuna by the plausible grata gentz'bus. So ξ 46 ex
quibus id facillime scire posset, H adds hommes scaltiet, a very crude
addition, while TE amplify into omnes sct'lz'cetLanuuz'm'. In ξ 79 quin sic
attendite abdices, H adds nempe. de ritterz'tu P. Clodi, the note of a sczblus
from the margin: TE develop this into nempe haec est quaestio de interitu
P. Clodi. So ξ 43 H gives quz' se ille [ipse Stangl] . . . putaret, which
does not construe: TE hide the corruption by quin se ille, which gives
a construction but perverts the sense. T is an especial offender in this
way, continually attempting to hide corruptions or to incorporate additions
in the text. ·
