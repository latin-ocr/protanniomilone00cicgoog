xl PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

§g neque : nec qnae. § 12. nonnulla: non nlla. ξ 27. Roma: Romam. .
§47. ut Q.: atque. §49. in noctem: innocentem. 561. cui: cni (ie.
ruens). §65. servos: serons. §68. haud: aut. §⁶9- qui quarn: quic·
qnan. ξ 72. Maelium: nelina. §73. populus Romanus: populns.
§ 74. hunc P. Varium: hunc c. p. Varz‘um. ξ 79. vultu: nattum T. anlt' E.
ξ 81. id fateri: assentari. §85. finesque : fines qnae. §9r. cadaveri curia:
cadaver in caria. §97. brevitatem: brevitate. §98. celebramur: cele-
bremur. §mn quo: quod. ι

To these should doubtless be added ξ 3⁶· non et: non ei (where H is
deficient), and ξ 69. communium: in communiam [see note ad loc.].

On the other hand I have only noted one agreement of HT in what
looks like a properas error, sc. ξ 16. ne necessarium: orn. ne, while those
common'to HE are limited in number, eg. ξ 78. ne cogitari: nec cogitari
It would not be to the point to quote here such readings as e. g. ᾗ 96. traec
arna, since these, whether n'ght or wrong, would easily be introduced
from one MS. into another by a corrector.

The following variants in TE are instructive :-

§38. agnovisset: orn. T; adcognovisset E. In the copy from which

E was taken iignoaisset must have been written: cognovisset being

a conjecture to fill up a lacuna in the archetype of TE, while ad· was
inserted sap. tin. by the corrector.

539. concurreret: cucurrerant T; cenrrerent E. Here E preserves
a slip in the archetype, sc. ccnrr. for nnn, which is further corrupted
in T.

ᾗ 77. adfecisse et: adfecisse T ; affecisset E. The latter reading must
have been in the archetype: T emends to obtain a construction.

ξ 78. spero multa vos liberosque vestros in re p. bona: before bona T
inserts natta, and E nestra, both filling up by'conjecture a vacant space
in the archetype.

§84 est, cst: est T, omitting a word: est egitur E, replacing it by
conjecture.

Aided by these instantes I expel without hesitation in ξ 42. salsam
placed in T before, and in E after fictam, as a gloss from the margin of
the archetype. The common origin of TE also explains in ᾗ 49 the
omission of noctu . . . credidetset, as was seen by Richter.

The points in which E differs frorn T are :-

(i) It contains passages and words omitted by the older MS. The
chief of these are, § 10. laurentus. ξς 12, 13. amentiam. . ,pn δ 21.
amicos . . agenat §28⁸ quod nunqnam sere. §gn de boc . . .est.
§45.manendi. §89.oppressesset. §104 non debitas. §105.etsort2sseinum.
