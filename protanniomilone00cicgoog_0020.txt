Oun knowledge of the events connected with the trial of Milo reaches
us from sources which are of very different value. 1 take first the Latin
writers. These are,—

(i) Asconius, a learned Roman, who wrote notes upon a number of
Cicero’s speeches, possibly upon all, for the instruction of his sons. By
an ingenious argument Kiessling and Schdll show that a commentos his
upon a passage in the pro Scauro can only have been written between
no. 54 and 57, i.e. early in the reign of Nero ². His sources of informa·
tion were very extensive, since henot only quotes from the Acta, but also
refers to historiam, orators, and poetS, whose works are now lost. He
carefully points out writings which he looked upon as spurious, and wrote
without any bias. He especially interested himself in points of minute
detail, such as the exact date of an event, the name of a speaker, or the
point of an obscure reference. His veracity and interest in research
make the fragments of his work one of the most priceless relics of anti-
quity. With Asconius we feel that we are on firm ground. Unfortunately
his text is in a very defective state, since we have only copies of the MS.
discovered at St. Gallen by Poggio in 1416.

(ii) 'Phe speeches and letters of cicero. The former are to be

used with great caution, since they are coloured by party spirit, and are
not free from wilful mIsrepresentation. Roman orators felt no shame in

such matters, and Cicero more than once confesses to having thrown dust
in the eyes of a jury ². The letters, on the other hand, especially those to
Atticus, frequently contain confidential insonnation of the highest import-
ance, and throw great light upon the ‘secret history’ of the time. '

(iii) casual notrices in other authors, e. g. Caesar, Suetonius, the
epitome of Livy, Pliny the Elder, Seneca, and Valerius Maximus.
Among these may be included Velleius Paterculus‚ from whose account
