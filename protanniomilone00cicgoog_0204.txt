DATE OF TRIAL OF MILO. 129

· MSS. have to be continually corrected, e.g. 32, 40, 51, 54. Ι would -
submit that this is a more simple explanation than to suppose that when
Asconius says przino die he means, not the day when Milo affuel, but
the day afterwards
There is, however, one difficulty in the way oi this proposal, the im·

κ portance oi which I do not wish to underrate. ln § 98 Cicero says
centcrzina lux est haec ab interitu P. Clodi et, opinor, allero, i. e. according
to the natural meaning oi the words, round. The rechoning as given
by modern editors is :-

Jan.18-29 = 12 days.

Feb. = 23 ‚‚

Mensis intercalaris = 28 ,‚

March , = 31 .,‚

April 1-8 = '8 ‚,

102 days.

If these figures are correct, then from Jan. 18 to Aprily would be
101 days only. It isos course possible that Cicero is calculating roughly‚

and perhaps not impossible that centesimo et altera -may mean ποιεῖ, ’

not round. 1 sho'uld, however, prefer to say that our knowledge oi the
Roman system oi intercalation is not sufficiently certain to enable us
to reclron with absolute accuracy. The intercalary month began some-
times on the 23²⁶, and sometimes on the 24th oi Feb, sometimes
consisting oi 28 and sometimes· 27 days. The possibility ol a special
ahtercalorz'r deis is also a point upon which critics are not yet agreed.
The subject is, however, a thorny and intricate one, upon which l do
not feel myseli competent -to pronounce, and I merely indicate the
difficulty which exists.
