PRO T. ANNIO MILONE. 5

tempestates et procellas in illis dumtaxat fluctibus contionum
semper putavi Miloni esse subeundas, quia semper pro bonis
contra improbos senserat; in iudicio vero et in eo consilio, in
quo ex cunctis ordinibus amplissimi viri iudicarent-numquam
5existimavi spem ullam esse habituros Milonis inimicos ad eius
non modo salutem exstinguendam, sed etiam gloriam per tales
viros infringendam. Quamquam in hac causa, iudices, T. Annio
tribunatu rebusque omnibus pro salute rei publicae gestis ad
huius criminis defensionem non abutemur. Nisi oculis videritis

Rab. Perd. 11, where Cicero speaks as
if Rabirius were to be crucified in the
Forum (Heitland, p. 38), while it ap·
pears probable that the only penalty
which threatened Sex. Roscius was the
usual oue in a trial inter sicarios [Zumpt,
p. 457 sq.]. If so, it is not surprising
that iu later life Cicero looked upon the
celebrated passage on the punishment
of the parricide as somewhat too florid,
Orat. 107.

carere: ‘be free from,’ cf. Rosc.
Am. 144, Rab. Post. 17. 'l'his sense of
the word does not fall under Cicero’s
definition, Tusc. D. i. 88 carcre hoc
significat, cgere eo, quod habere velis.

‘It isespecially used to lay emphasis upon·

the personal views of the speaker. Cicero
em loys it only with the ist pers. sing.
ancl it is most frequent iu the langnage
of conversation. Thus it is rare in the
philosophical wn'tings and most common
in the letters to Atticus) The confusion
with et quidem in MSS. is constant : for
the latter hrase in the sense of ‘and that
too‚' cf. Plane. 87, l’hil. vii. 5 and xi. 9,
and RH. n. 429.

1. numitius contionum: Cicero is
fond of this metaphdr, eg. Mur. 35.
The passage is quoted by Quintil. viii 6.
48, as an example of one in which some
of the words are used in a meta·
phorical and others in a literal sense,
‘nisi adiecisset dumtaxat fluct. contionum
esset allegoria: nunc eam miscuit.’

3. sonunt: the verb is frequently
used of politieal sympathiea e. g. Rosc.
Ani. 14² fateor me errasse. . .qui cum
illis senserim, tametsi inermis, iudices,
semi. ln Fam.i.9.17 non offendes
eundem bonorum sensum, Lentule, quem

reliquisti, qui confirmatus consulatu nostro
.. . interruptus, adflictus . . . recreatus
derelictus, &c sensus appears to
mean ‘ party’ or ‘policy.‘

4. metis: i.e. senators, equites,
and trib. aerarii, the latter representing
the less privileged classes of the com-
munity. Reid suggests coniunctis, which
is pointed to by the corruption in ll; but
the variant, sc. coniunctus fontanetus, is
notan uncommon one, cf. Verr. iv. 145.

5. spem . . . ad: the only parallel
¹uoted is An. xv. 20. r tantum spei
habere ad vivendum. Guttmann [p. 10]
thinks that the usage may be a colloquial
one.

6. euntem: t.t. for the caput or
incolumitas of a civis, so § 39 restitutor
salutis ciccae. 't‘he citizen in full enjoy-
ment of his privileges is salvus, or inco-
lumis: while loss of rights is calantitas,
and the penalized person calamitosus.

9. nist. . ‚munaum these words
contain a complete plan of the speech.
His constitutio causac as given, §5 23, 31,
will be ‘uter utri insidias fecerit) He will
not like Brutus (Ascon. 4²) base his
defence on the plea that, although murder
was really committed, the evil was re·
deemed by the good to the state -qualitas
confirmativa-nor will he take refuge in
deprecatio, which is hardly appropriate in
judicial proceedings, ad Herenn. i. ²4·
These form his second line of defence,
extra causam. In §5 72-82 he argues
the case after the manner of Brutus, and
in ξς 83-91 takes up the point suggested
here by populi Rom. felicitati, sc. that
aspecial providence was at work. Finally
§92 sq., he resorts to deprecatio or an
pppeals for mercy, not to Milo, but to

imsel.

After the bulting beginning he ventures
