AUTHORITIES FOR EVENTS OF 52 Bc. xi

Tiro’s memoirs of Cicero, letters of the latter to Herodes, Gorgias, δια,
now lost, letters of Brutus to Atticus, and other contemporary writings.
That he was inexact will surprise no one. Thus he says that Caesar
prosecuted Clodius de ancestu [ch. 28], and that the senate decreed Cicero
atriumph after his return from Cilicia [ch. 37]. The date which he assigns
to Pompeys marriage with Comelia‚ after his entry into Rome and
before carrying his lawS, is hardly consistent with the account of Asconius,
which impiies that the marriage had already taken place in Jan. 52.

(vi) Dio cassius, who was consul nu. ²²9 under Alexander Severus,
has written a valuable account of the incidents [xl. 48-55]. His view of the
situation is very just, while he gives independent information which appears
to have been founded upon documentary evidence. He has a tendency to
exaggerate, e. g. his account of Cicero's breakdown at the trial is certainly
overdrawn. There are also some minor inaccuracies. Thus he says
that Milo was not condemned for ambriae, after his condemnation for vir.
When he remarks that under the laws of Pompey either party could chal-
lenge five J‘urors, he does not explain that this meant live from each order,
i. e. fifteen in all. Also, he appears to antedate the ren. conr. ultrhrum¹.

(vii) Appian, who lived under Hadrian, compares very disadvan-
tageously with the other writers on this subject. The most extraordinary
of his blunders is a statement that Pompey sent Cato to Cyprus to get
him out of the way ; obviously a confusion with· the mission which Cato
undertook in 58· under a measure of Clodius! If Appiau had looked at
this speech, he would have seen that Cato was on the jury. His account
of the contio held by Caelius is a curious one. He conceives that Caelius
brought Milo before a meeting of the Comitia assembled for judicial
purposes, hoping that if he were there ‘acquitted,' he would escape in
subsequent proceedings. The plot, however, was frustrated by τὸ
ἀδιάφθορον τοῦ πλήθους, and these ‘incorruptibles' then went on to a great
not, in which they singled out well-dressed persons whom they killed'for
their jewelleryl. An equally improbable statement is that Milo was
leaving Rome on the day of the murder in order to retire to his native
Lanuvium, being distressed by Pompey's faithlessness towards him³.
His account of the trials which took place under Pompey's laws isan
extraordinary jumbie, which I can only account for, by supposing that he
has compressed into this year all the trials of which he had any record in
