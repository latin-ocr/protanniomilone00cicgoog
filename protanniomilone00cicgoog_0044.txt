THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xxxiii

(11) Lagg, the MSS. collated by the learned Jesuit, Lagomarsini‚ ‘of

which only 43, and the second hand in 6, 13, 18, possess any value ¹.’
’ (111)Ο1111.,166 Oxford MSS, of which a misleading and imperfect
collation was published in the large Clarendon Press edition 61 1783.
Ι have mysell recollated 161 this speech those 61 16661 which appeared to
throw light upon the history of the text

To these may be added the British Museum MSS, Harl. 2681, 4852,
5428, 16980 ; Ar. 2363 Burn. 155, 157, 159, which, upon examinatior,
I found to belong to the worst class of deterreres. Also the Vatican
MSS„ ottoboni, 1456, 1466, 1596 1710, 19913 Vat. 1741, 1743, 1744,
· 1745, 1746, 683y; Vat. Urb. 3²0 ; Regin. 18253 Reg. Suec. 1486; test-
passages in which were examined by my friends, Mr. S. G. Owen, 61
Christ Church, and Mr. T. W. Allen, of Queen’s College. Some 61 these
doubtless figure among the Lagg.

I add some marks by which the dett. may be 1666566661-

) 36. riadicr'umne triani: the early dett. omit these words, the later ones
insert intentavit, or Milo attulit 7617717611.

§ 60. ι1771,177,1177]16,’67167’ causa: variously corrupted, e. g. heus ubi
responsio, ubi causa, or abi Casca.

§ 78. nr‘lu'l. . .P. 0177176 arira: a large omission, 771 homoeoteleuta, occurs.

Other passages are: § ²5· Collinam: calamam. § ²9· qui animo fideli
in dominum et praesenti fuerunt: qui animo fid. r‘n dominum erant 71
praesentes fuerunt. § 36. in causa aut mala aut mea, non et praeclarissima
61 vestra iudicium: r'n c. aut vestra mala aut mea nec praecl. 71 riadiciam.
§53. om. edito. §83. vim esse ducit: variously corrupted. 886. orn.
decoris. ς 91. ad Castoris: ac 1711111.

The 71711. fall into two classes: (7) 166 older ones, forming the raw
material, out 61 which the fifteenth-century recension was constructed‚
and (6) 166 later MSS, which are practically editions, and embody the
results gained by the labours 61 successive scholare. In these we can
trace the operation 61 three factors, (1) conjecture pure and simple, (ii) the
development 61 corruptions found in the older MSS, and (111) the r’nfiltra-
11677 aff superior readings, r'nlraducedsrom 1177 071677166717. 11 is to the
last factor that 6 owes its position.

The genesis of s will be best understood if it is compared with certain
Oxford MSS. These are-

(1) Auct. Rawl. G. 138 [6],1661166616 century, a good specimen 61166
early 77111161 of nalred corruptions, not yet veiled by the ltalian scholars.

(11) Coll. Nov. ccxlix [χ], 61166616 century, a caresully emended MS,
closely connected with r.
