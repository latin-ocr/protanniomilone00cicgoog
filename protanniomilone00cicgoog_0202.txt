Tua Duru or reru 'furna orM1L0.

Acconnruc to the MSS. reading in Ascon. 31 the speech of Cicero
was delivered a. d. vi Id. April, i. e. on April 8. In another passage,
where he speaks of the summus rudici dies (Ascon. 41), ad ui is in·
troduced by conjecture. The MSS. give ad. iii, or ii. The same
authority says (Ascon. 40) that the day fixed for the beginning of the
trial was April 4, prid. Non. April. reum adesse iussit. If these dates
are accepted, the trial should extend over five days ’

In the account of what actually took place, however, we find only four
days mentioned. Asconius is here perfectly explicit. He says pruno die
there was a riot, then per biduum the witnesses were heard in silence,
then postero daie, qui suit rudici summus, came the sortitio riede'cum and
the pleading (Ascon. 41). At the end of the third day a centr’o was
addressed by Plancus, who urged the multitude to attend postero die, and
intimidate the jury. This contib, he says elsewhere (on§ γι), was held J
past audita et adsignata testeum uerba, and Cicero in the speech also calls
it hesterna contio (§ 3).

The language of Asconius is less clear when he is giving the contents
of the law (ib. 40). He says there that it was ordained that the witnesses
should be heard pertriduum, then quarta die adesse amnes in diam posterum
iuberentur ac . . . pilae . . . aequarentur, dein rursus postero dee sortitio
fieret, dec. and the final hearing should take place. The old interpre-
tation of this passage was that ‘on the fourth day the jurors should
be ordered to assemble on the following, i.e. the fifth, day, and the
aequatio priorum should take place. Then on the following, i.e. the fifth,
day the pleadings were to ensue.'

Some editors, accepting this scheme, suppose that the fourth day of
the trial was practically ‘a blank day,’ nothing taking place in it beyond ,
the aequatio priorum. A fatal objection to this is that in this case the
speech of Plancus, which came immediately after the hearing of the
evidence, would have been not on the eve of the summus dies, as is
repeatedly asserted, but of the day before it. Also it does not agree
with the subsequent account, where only four days are mentioned.
