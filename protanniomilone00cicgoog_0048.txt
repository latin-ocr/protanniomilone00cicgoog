THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xxxvii

largely from it, generally citing it to support H, to thch he attached
most weight, or E, the three MSS. together forming his praeclaro trigo.

On putting together the evidence furnished by these three scholars,
I was struck by the close agreement of W with T. This may be seen
by the following cases, in all of which WT agree against HE. Where
sol. is added, the reading is not quoted from any other source. The letters
F. L. and G. refer to Fabricius, LambinuS, and Gulielmius respectively.

(ι) Proprii errores of WT: ξ a. tempori: temporibus WF. ξ 33. libra-
rium WF. [one Lag]

(a) Spellings: ξ 16. domui, v. c. L. ξ 39. plebei, v. c. L. [sol] ξ 51. de·
vorotwf.

(3) Notable variants: 5 15. quid vos in iudicando spectare oporteret:
om. in o. c. L. [one Lag] ξ 3¹- quod multis in causis saepe: :om before
saepe add v. c. L. [rol] ξ 76. vestra tecta, vestras pecunias. Pecunias
dico: vestros pecunias, oestro tecto dico WF. [sol.], a strange inversion.
§ 78. spero multa vos liberosque vestros in rep. bona esse visuros:
‘Werd repetit in rep. multo bona' G. [sol] ξ 90. cum mortuus ono,
v. c. L.

The differences are trivial‚ e. g. ξ 85. Latiari: ‘Werdensis Latzoret ut
videatur scriptum primitus Latrone* G. In T we find lotio rei. So
§go non etpraeclor.: ‘nostri libri sic habent' F. Ei is given for et in T.
The same corruption was probably in W; an early scholar would not
notice so small a point, especially when for the first time remedying
a serious dislocation of the text. On ξ 45' Lambinus ascribes statuto for
stato to W [stota T with HE]. This is probably an error, as so good
a MS. is not likely to have had this gloss, found only in late dett. An
important case is ξ 79. euocare: ίν. c. euocare, in altero MS. auocare’ F.
Here W breaks away from T, which has avocare, showing that T mis-
represents the archetype.

The only other speech for which W is quoted is the de Imp. Cn. Pompei.
Here the materials are scanty, since we depend upon Gulielmius alone,
and the readings he gives are also found in HE, as well as in T. Also
T is mutilated, containing only §i 47-71. An interesting case is ξ 50,
where Gulielmius falsely ascribes to H the variant adigendus sor deli·
gendus. As this, however, occurs in T, there can be no doubt that
Gulielmius found it in W, and ascribed it to the wrong MS.

The evidence given above tends to show that W was a gemellus of T.
It would remove complexity, if it could be identified with 'T; but (1) the
description of it given by Fabricius implies that it contained the whole of
the de Imp. Cn. Pompei, whereas T is fragmentary, and (a) T also contains
the Philippics, pro Sulla, pro Plancio, pro Caecina and pro Marcello
