day ¹. He appears to have looked upon his office as a virtual dictator-
ship. A dictator retained his power for six months only, and Pompey
voluntarily imposed upon himselfa similar restrictiori of time. Upon
the first of August he, as Mommsen says, ‘resigned his dictatorship, and
shared the consulship with his client, Metellus Scipio λ’ It is obvious
that by this time his task must have been completed, since otherwise
he would not have surrendered the extraordinary powers granted to him.
Two trials, however, those of the tribunes, Plancus Bursa and Pompeius
Rufus are supposed to have taken place sometime after the others, at the
end of the year, or early in 51 nc. This is inferred from the well-known
fact that the tribunes entered upon and vacated office on Dec. 10. lt is
therefore argued that their trial must have been subsequent to this date.
The most important document bearing upon the subject is a letter of
Cicero, written shortly after the condemnation of Bursa ⁸. ln this he
says, ‘nos hic in multrludine et celebritate riedirierum elnonis legibus ita
distinemur, ut cotidie vota faciamus, ne intercaletur, ut quam primum
te videre possimus,' i.e. he is very busy with cases, and fears that the
vacation, during which he would visit his correspondent, may be put ,
off by a possible intercalation. ·Schmidt, in his careful discussion of the
date to be assigned to this letter, is inclined to place the trial of Plancus
at the end of January, or the beginning of February in 51 ⁴. 1 would remark
»that the phrase multitudo et celebritas indictorum would be appropriate
if it were written at the time when Cicero and Hortensius were pleadhg
every day in fresh cases ⁶, but is somewhat out of place, if these two trial!
came by themselves and formed a sequel to the general body of cases.
The mention of novae leger also suggests the period of Pompeys ex-
ceptional power, rather than 51 nc, when he was no longer in office, and
things had gone back to their normal condition. The intercalation
referred to is supposed by Schmidt to be the ordinary one ofa month
in February, such as had taken place in 52 nc. As a matter of. fact,
however, there was no intercalation in 51, so that, if this was what
Cicero feared, his apprehensions were not realised. ln the accounts
given by later writers, it is never hinted in any way that the cases of
the two tribunes were separated by any considerable interval from the
others. Dio Cassius⁶ says ὅτε οὖν Μίλων οὕτως ἔιίλω καὶ ὁῬοῦφος ὅ τε
Πλάγκος, ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον ἐκ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἐξῆλθον, ἄλλοι τε σὺν αὐτοῖς συχνοί,
