xxxii PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE.

upon slender evidence. That the pro Milone was not much read in
the middle ages is clear lrom a glauce at the ancient catalogues pre·
served to ue. It only occurs three times in the lists collected by Manilius,
sc. in the catalogues of Lorsch and Cluny.

Lursclr [cent. ix]. 445. Metrum Tullii Ciceronis (sc. Aratea), orationes
pro Cluentio, pro Milone, in Pisonem, pro Cornelio ¹.

Cluny [cent. xiil. 41²· Defensio Marci Tullii pro Milone. il. 496.
Cicero pro Milone, et pro Avito, et pro Murena, et pro quibusdam aliis².

The fact ol its existence at Lorsch in the ninth century is ol some
importance, in view os a not improbable conjecture which has been made,
connecting one os our MSS. with that great seat ol mediaeval erudition ³. ·

The MSS. which we now possess are easily classified. They are-

(A) Ρ, run ensmrsus'rus Tnunruuusrs, of which only a few fragments
remam. -

(Β) Trru Genuam MSS, three in number, sc. H [Harleianus 2682],
T [T egernseenstig and Erfurtensz‘s [E]. To these may be added W, the
lost Werdensn.

(C) Trur uunsraunu on rurunron MSS, chiefly of Italian origin.

Ol these the last were exclusively used by scholars until 1569, when
F. Fabricius published a selection ol readings from the Werdensis. Since
then their inferiority, as compared with members ol the German family,
has been increasingly recognised. Baiter says tersely, &interpolatis codicibus
Ilolz'cis nullo fides haberi polest’ ; a judgment which will commend itsell to
every inquiror. I should not linger over them, but lor the singular occur·
rence that one very late MS, the Salisburgensis [e] is quoted as a serious
authority, without, so far as 1 am aware, any sufficient inquiry having
been made into its pedigree. Thus Richter, a very acute critic, pays
great regard to e, and considers the readings of H due to conjecture,
unless supportedby al, a view ingeniously perverse. Also in my Anecdoton
1 spoke ol it as a late descendant of H, ajudgment which Ι now retract.

In order to realise the position of e, it is necessary to discuss the
affinities of the deterreres. As the result is an important one, 1 may be
pardoned for going into some detail. The best known members of this
very large lamily are-

(i) B. [Barberinus ix. 11] xiii. cent, used by Garatoni, and recently
by Nohl ⁴.

¹ M. Marinus, Philologisches aus alten Bibliotheks-Kntalogen, Rhein. Mos. xxvii.
lllthtgl sapin.
⁴ A lull collation ol this MS. would be ol interest, as it must be one ol the earliest

dett. The select readings given in Nohl's notes do not, however, show any deviatione
lrom the vulgar recension.
