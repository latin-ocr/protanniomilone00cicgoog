1. Ι. Favonio: Cato's devoted fol·
lower, called by Mommsen, iv. 315, his
‘Sancho’ Cf. Dio C. xxxviii. 7 Κάτωνος
ζηλωτὴς ἐς τὰ μάλιστα, He was at this
time quaesitor de sodaliciis, and, like his
master, carried impartiality to an excess.
The MSS. omit M. after etiam by a fa·
miliar lipography. Asconius 5 3 gives the
praenomen, audisse eum a M. Favonio,

point is that onyonr could easily find out

,all about it. The various order in the
position olid in TE, coupled with its
omission in the dett, indicates that it is
nn addition from the margin of the arche-
ykeollamna: ‘annual,' so frequently of
ludi, epulae, sacrificia.

goddess whose somewhat quaint attire, ‘ in
goatskin and tumed·up shoes, together
§uqa spear and small shield,’ is described

prouentum: ‘nominate,' t. t. of the
choice made by a close corporation of
privileged persons, eg. Dom. 38 quem
[sc. interregem] et ipsum patricium esse,
et a patricio prodi necesse est. Asconius
tells us, that Milo was to nominate the
flamen on the next day, so that, as Trojel
points out, Milo might have kept his
engagement by starting early on the 19th.

order to establish a connection between it
and Clorlius' sudden departure the day
before. The words which follow in the
MSS. quod erat dictator Lanuvi Milo are
ascholium from the margin, as is suf·
ficiently shown by the ungrammatical erat.
'l'he information is to be found iu Ascon.
32 ex quo erat munr'cr'pio et ili turn dic-
tator: for scholia taken from the same
source cf. ἕξ 46, 90. Recent editors
defend the words on the ground that, as
Cicero was writing the speech afterwards,
he added this piece of information for the
render, and so drop ed into the indicative.
This does not seem likely, since he always
tries to produce the illusion of spoken
discourse, e. g. Verr. iv. 5. &e

see Ascon. lc.

8. quod re: Cicero boldly states as
a fact, what he only attempts to prove in

10. tamquarm: this ought to mean
that he actually avent away from it, just as
a contione relinqui [cf. Brut. 305] means
thatthe speaker isleftalone by hismeeting.
The contio here in question is obviously
the one also alluded to in §45 at quo diet
&a Asconius, who had the Acta before
him, says there that the reference is to
a meeting on the 18th, and his words
suggest that there was no meeting on the
17th. Cicero in ξ 45 intentionally uses
ambiguous language which might refer to
a meeting either on the 18th or on the
17th. For the same reason in both

Cicero is silent on this point. He repre· passages he uses the misleading verb
sents Milo's engagement as pressing, in reliquisset. In 5 45, however, he could
