HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xvii

should be given to the various charges brought against his private
character. Our information largely comes from Cicer0, who is a pre-
judiced witness. The orator was a good hater, and it was a necessity of
his nature to have an enemy. Clodius may not have been so black as ·

’ he is painted. We know from Cicero himself that there was much that
was channing in the complicated and many-sided character of Catiline ¹.
An act of generous forgiveness on the part of Clodius became classic ².
The Roman nobles, who were always ready to overlook peccodr'llos in an
aristocrat, petted Clodius ³, and evidently looked on him as an amusing
person, not quite responsible for his actions. However‚ after making all
possible allowanceS, it cannot be doubted that he was devoid of all
conscience, and paraded his contempt for law, order, and morals in an
unblushing manner. This cynicism was characteristic of the young men
of the day, and in him we find an exaggeration of the type to which
Curio, Caelius Dolabella, and many others belonged. As a politician his
chief object was s'enconoz'ller, and so successful was he in this that he is ἴ
known to history, like his equally famous and more brilliant sister, not by .
his patrician name of Claudias, but by the popular pronunciation of the
name. He had no serious end in view except to amuse himself by
making government impossible, while his peculiar delight was to worry
his sensitive enemy Cicero, or to reduce to impotence Pompey the Great.

Clodius reigned through his operae, or ‘gangs‚’ which broke -up Μ
meetings, shed blood freely, and controlled both the streets and the
comitia. The nucleus of these probably consisted of freedmen,a class
which must have been attracted to him by his revival of the old demo-
'cratic proposal to enrol them equally in all the tribes. He also, by an
innovation in Roman politics, employed slaves. One of his most notable
achievements, that in fact upon which his power rested ⁴, was the
legalization in 58 of the so=called collegziz Compzioliczo, or religious
guilds of the lower orders to which slaves were admitted as well as
citizens ⁶. These guilda were turned into political clubs‚ and received
a semi-military organization ⁶. Rome was mapped out into districts aud
each ward had its officers. It needed but aword from Clodius to call
forth his sinister battalions from the alleys and slums, and with their aid
he could terrorize Rome. Even the great Pompey was imputent in the
face of these organized rioters, and together with the matronales in general
hailed a saviour of society in the person of Milo.
T. Annius Milo Papianus was of municipal origin on his father’s side, ,³ ·. ,
