HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xxiii

speech Cicero makes no reply to these charges, and says nothing of
Milo’s movements after the murder.

The story oi the arrival of the body in Rome, the theatrically-expressed
grief of Fulvia, the surging crowd round the great house on the Palatino,
the carrying oi the nahed corpse into the Forum, where, with ghastly
realism, it was placed upon the Rostra, is dramatically told by our authori·
ties. The final outbreak reminds us of the similar scene which took
place some eight years afterwards.

First eit. ‘Come away, away!

We’ll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.
Take up the body.

Second eit. Go setch fire.

Third cit. Pluck down benches

Fourth cit. Pluck down forms, windows, anything¹.'

Not the least striking feature in this last outrage upon public decency
was that the tribunes, Plancus and Q. Pompeius Rufus, were ring·
leaders in the riot‚ and themselves ‘singed2' in the gigantic bonfire,
which consumed the careass ol the demagogue. The impression created
was so prosound that even Milo ventured back, and audaciously resumed
his canvass.

The time, however, had now arrived, when Pompey's tortuous policy
was beginning to bear fruit. Nothing but martial law could cure the
maladies which afflicted the state. This was clear to the general body
pt reflecting persons, who were not committed to either party. Even the
sooty rioters, still begrimed with the smoke of the funeral pyre, ended by
shouting themselves hoarse lor Pompey, whether as consul or dictator,
but above all, Pompey³. It only remained to convert the extremists
in the senate.

It is important to remember, that at this period Pompey, as pro-
consul, was outside Rome ⁴, and had no legal right to enter the city.
He therefore remained in inactivity in his horti, calculating that
sooner or later it would be necessary lor the optimates to offer him
the post, which he coveted, in order to obtain his presence in Rome.
Meanwhile they endeavoured to govern without him by appointing an
interrex. The attempt failed, since they had no military force to back
them. The interrex was besieged in his house throughout his five days
