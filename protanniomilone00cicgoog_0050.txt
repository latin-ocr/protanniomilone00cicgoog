THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT, xxxix

himself still os uertere opinion ¹. This opinion may therefore be
considered to hold the field.

The conclusion at which I have myself arrived is widely different. It
is thatE is a‘contaminated’ MS, being a mixture of two recensions.
It has been copied from the same source as T, but corrected by
superscriptions and additions drawn from H or a similar MS.

As the question is one of vital importance for the criticism of the
speech, I may be pardoned for discussing it at length. The facszim'le
of the Miloniana, as given in E, published by Wunder, is an accessible
work, and renders the examination into the character of the MS.
a simple one. On going through this, and marking agreements of E with
T and with H, and also peculiarities of its own, I found that it was
infinitely nearer in its affinities to T than to H. The numerical results are
much as follows. Agreements with T against H 224, with H against T
81, peculiarities 70. I do not of course guarantee the absolute accuracy
of the figures, but the proportions may be taken as correct. The sections
for which His deficient I exclude from the calculation. Similar results
may be arrived at from other points of view. Thus ou going through
the variants from Baiter's text given in my Anecdoton, and excluding
trivial points of spelling, I find that H agrees with E against T 48 times,
with T against E 8 times, and has 403 peculiarities, many of which are
of course mere slips of atrivial kind. Again, taking Wunder’s variants
from the text of Ernesti, it appears that E agrees with T against H
76 times, with H against T 38 times and has 76 peculiarities. All these ·
methods show that E is much more closely related to T than to H,
agreeing with the former constantly, and with the latter only occa-
sionally.

In estimating the affinities of MSS. it is necessary to bear in mind
the difference between those readings which may have been introduced
by a corrector, and thosewhich testify to ‘consanguinity’ Of the
latter the most important are proprii errores, ie. flaws due to a slip of
the pen on the part of the copyist who transcribed the common arche-
type.

Ι instance the following, to which I desire to call special attention.
A reading italicised without comment is common to TE :-

¹ Iwish to treet with all respect so able a scholar and so courteous a disputant
as Dr, Nohl. He will, however, forgive me for pointing out that in the leret.
Anhang to his edition of 1892, he has taken t'or granted the correctness of the
ordinary recensiou, i.e. that based upon E, and then tabulated the variants of H aa
omissione, additions, alterations, &c This point, however, must first be proved,
since until this is done such remarks rest upon a petitio primipii.
