HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION. xxv

empanelled after the ordinary method. If Pompey had allowed this to
pasS, he would have stultified himself. Milo must be tried by martial
law, or not at all. All the usual machinery by which a verdict was
extorted from a jury would have been put into motion. Bribery would
have been practised upon a colossal scale. The yurors would be intimi·
dated by the number of laudatores, men of rank like⁴ Faustus Sulla, or of
moral influence, such as Brutus and Cato. The dialectic of Hortensius,
the gibes of Caelius, the pathos of Cicero, that great master who could
work upon their feelings as a musician on the strings of a lyre¹, would all
be brought to bear on them. The advocate would not shrink from that
final coup which had once snatched a notorious criminal from justice ².
He would bare the breast of Milo, and show the scars, all in front, dealt

by the gangs of Clodius On going to vote the jurors would have to pass ’
on either side a line of weeping friends, imploring them individually for
mercy⁸. Under this ordeal the morals, the intelligence, or the nerves of
a jury might well have given way. This part of the proposal was there·
fore vetoed, and Pompey was at liberty to bring in his own laws. These
were two in number, one dealing with the riotous acts in question, and
another with the bribery which had been recently praetised⁴. The
special obJects of these laws were to secure brevity in the proceedings, to
make corruption impossible, and to curb the eloquence of the orators.
The hearing of evidence was to be the chief part of the trial. Two hours·
only were allowed for the speech of the prosecuting counsel, and three
for the reply. The jurors who were to vote were only chosen out of
alarger body on the morning of the last day; an ingenious provision
which put bribery out of the question. These measures were wisc
ones Pompey found Rome in anarchy. The only remedy was to pro·
claim a state of siege, and to proceed by martial law. The orators,
however, were highly indignant at the ‘gag’ thus put upon their elo·
quence, and Caelius attached Pompey as the ‘gagger’ with such violence
that he could only be silenced by the threat to use force.

Under the provision of the law, the Presidents in these two courts were
to be elected by the popular vote: in the case of the more important
commission, that de m, only an exaconsul could be appointed. L. Domi·
tius Ahenobarbus, a representative optimate, was nominated by Pompey⁸‚
and duly elected. Pompey won general admiration by the fairness with
which he formed the list of jurors, selecting the most honest and distin·
