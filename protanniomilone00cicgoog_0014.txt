PREFACE

-00—

IN these dayS, when the texts of classical authors are so
constantly republished‚ it is, Ι conceive, the first duty of an
editor to give some reason for the existence of his work.
I therefore proceed to briefly explain the circumstances which
have led to the appearance of this volume.

In a previous work Ι indicated the importance for this speech
of the new material furnished by the Harleian MS. 26821.
Ι then intended to publish, as I hoped, soon afterwards a
revised text of the Miloniana accompanied by some critical
notes. Ι discovered, however, before long that the task Ι had
engaged upon was more difficult than Ι had anticipated. In
the first place, owing to doubts which presented themselves
concerning the value of a well-known MS„ the SalisburgensiS,

I found it necessary to make a collation of this, the result being .

to considerably modify the view of its merit which I had pre-
viously entertained. In order to better comprehend the process
which has led to the formation of the inferior recension‚ found
in the later MSS„ Ι also collated several Oxford viss-a
tedious task‚ but not, I hope, wholly without fruit. Secondly,
upon making a more minute study of the oration, Ι felt that
in several passages there was little reason for the interpretations
which had become traditional, while real difficulties existed
