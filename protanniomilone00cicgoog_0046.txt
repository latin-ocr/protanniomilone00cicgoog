THE SOURCES OF THE TEXT. xxxv

550. add. noctu occidisset, insidioso et pleno latronum in loco occi-
disset. §59. incesti. §91. ab inferis. §99. saltem. In §78, where
the lacuna, common to all the dett, viz. nihil horum . . . Clodio vivo, has
been filled up, hc give igiturest with H, as against cst igitur TE. The
natural conclusion to draw from these facts is that in the fifteenth century
there was in circulation a collection of variants, taken from Transalpine
sources, which gradually became embodied in the Italian MSS, s
being the most highly corrected member of the family. It follows-

(i) That c adds nothing to the authority of H, where they agree sol.

(ii) That when s or other late MSS, being thoroughly vulgar in type,
contain a plausible reading, not found in the early dett, and equally absent
from the German MSS, that reading must be looked upon with great
suspicion, as probably due to Italian conjecture, e. g. ξ 63. percito, lc in
mg, sin text ᾖ 69. c'cnmutalci add. χ, immutatus ς.

(iii) That the use of r and the other dett. is practically nil, except in
those rare cases where they have preserved an original reading, while the
meliores are corrupt.

lam conscious that they might be generally disregarded, but as it
seemed advisable to put their readings on record, 1 have given the more
important variants of σχε, marking their agreement by the symbol δι.

I add a few words conceming three other Oxford MSS. :-

(i) Coll. Line. xxxix, termed s in the Clarendon Press edition. To oxford
avoid confusion l call it λ. This is a very correct MS, and interesting MSS·
from its close resemblance to the editio prcicccps of Sweynheym and
Pannartz, Rome, 1471, which I term Σ. zi agree in the order of the
speeches, and in the Ilfz'lcm'ana are extraordinarily alike. I quote the
following-51. cum: cumcontra. §5. duobus: de uobz's. ξ 14. veteri·
bus: tuentibus. §64 frenorum: add. cipccrorum λ, sparorum Σ.
§ 70. iudicia: cicdc'cc'c's. The MS. was not copied from the printed book,
since it contains a number of enors corrected in it, e. g. ξ 3. praeirent a:
praedicerent λ. §aa caedere 2: caedem λ. §45. stata 2: statuta λ.
The most striking variant of λ is ξ 67 tutetur for custodat, where it is not
followed by Σ.

(ii) Coll. Nov. cccii, tenned χ3 by the Oxford collators2. This is
in a-hand which appears to be Flemish, and contains two notable

ιΙ do not intend by this symbol to cast any slur upon σχς as compared
with the mass of the dett, for which it would be difficult to find any appropriate
expression.

¹ This MS. is described, Praei. p. 16, where it is said not to have been collated. Its
readings are, however, given in the varniae lectiones, in which it is called χ’. This
name isunfortunate, since χ3 is also employed to signify a duplicate copy of catil. ii.
and pro Rege Deiot. in χ (Coll. Nov. ccxlix, see p. xxxiii).
